# Summary

In this tutorial, we configured a device dynamically with the `fioctl`
command. Keep in mind that you can send more than one file to the
device, allowing you to configure more than one application. This
configuration file feature can be associated with a `device group`,
allowing you to update not just one device but a group of devices.
