# Creating your first Target

In the previous tutorial "`tutorial-gs-with-docker`", you created your
first application locally. This provided a brief overview of Docker
containers and `docker-compose` apps. In this tutorial, you will learn
what a **Target** is, how to generate one, and how your device consumes
it.
