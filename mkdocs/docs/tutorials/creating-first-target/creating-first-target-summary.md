# Summary

This tutorial shows you what a **Target** is and all the steps to create
one. All the commands used in this Tutorial together with
"`tutorial-gs-with-docker`", will be part of a daily development flow
when you are working with FoundriesFactory.

The flow to develop your application is simple:

-   Try it locally.
-   Send your changes to FoundriesFactory CI.
-   CI will build and create a **Target**.
-   The device will receive it over-the-air.
