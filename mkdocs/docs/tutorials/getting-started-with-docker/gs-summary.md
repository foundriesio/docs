# Summary

You have learned the basic commands and structure of Docker and
`docker-compose` applications. At this point, if you just created your
Factory, the initial build should be finished. In the next tutorial, you
will commit and push your changes to the remote `containers.git`
repository. FoundriesFactory CI will then build and deploy this
application as a **Target** which can be applied to your device.

Warning

If you followed this tutorial before flashing and registering your
device, return to the `Getting Started` section and complete the
following:

> -   `gs-flash-device`.
> -   `gs-register`.
