Zephyr microPlatform Reference Manual
=====================================

The Foundries.io Zephyr microPlatform is an extensible
software and hardware platform that makes it easier to develop,
secure, and maintain Internet-connected microcontroller-based embedded devices.

.. note::

   Just getting started? Check out :ref:`tutorial-zephyr` in the
   :ref:`tutorial`.

The Zephyr microPlatform is based on the `Zephyr`_ real-time operating
system, and the `MCUBoot`_ secure bootloader.

In addition to these components, it includes:

- reference applications which can be used in concert with the Linux
  microPlatform and cloud system containers provided by Foundries.io
  to create functional IoT systems.

- infrastructure to make continuous testing and deployment of your
  Zephyr applications easier.
