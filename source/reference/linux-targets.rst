Additional Linux microPlatform Targets
======================================

This section provides information on running the Linux microPlatform
for other targets. It is provided on a best-effort basis.

Prebuilt Binaries
-----------------

Several boards have reference builds provided by Foundries.io
in the latest Linux microPlatform release, available at
https://github.com/foundriesio/lmp-manifest/releases/latest.

Please note that these builds are provided for reference in hopes they
are useful; not all receive equal testing.

Generic RISC-V 64 Machine
-------------------------

.. toggle-header::
   :header: Click to show/hide

   Set ``MACHINE`` to ``qemuriscv64`` when setting up your work
   environment with the ``setup-environment`` script::

     MACHINE=qemuriscv64 source setup-environment [BUILDDIR]

   Build the Linux microPlatform minimal image ``lmp-mini-image``
   instead of the usual ``lmp-gateway-image``, as there is no golang
   and docker support for RISC-V yet::

     bitbake lmp-mini-image

   The artifacts required by QEMU are ``bbl`` (Berkeley Boot Loader +
   Kernel + initrd) and ``lmp-mini-image-qemuriscv64.ota-ext4`` in
   ``deploy/images/qemuriscv64``.

   **Boot the generic RISC-V target with QEMU**

   At the end of the build, change directory to where the build
   artifacts are found, then copy the image to where ``runqemu``
   expects it and run it::

     cd deploy/images/qemuriscv64
     cp lmp-mini-image-qemuriscv64.ota-ext4 lmp-mini-image-qemuriscv64.ext4
     runqemu nographic slirp qemuparams="-m 512"

   Please see
   https://wiki.qemu.org/Documentation/Networking#User_Networking_.28SLIRP.29
   for information and additional details on networking restrictions.

   **SSH into guest**

   You can SSH into the RISC-V 64 guest by using the port forwarded to
   the RISC-V 64 guest::

     ssh -p 2222 osf@localhost

   Please see https://wiki.qemu.org/Documentation/Platforms/RISCV for additional
   information.
