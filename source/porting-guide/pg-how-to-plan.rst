How to plan the porting
-----------------------

According to the boot flow described in :numref:`ref-pg-boot-flow-diagram`, some required packages are clear: U-Boot, OP-TEE, TF-A, and the Linux
Kernel. The recommendation is to start with the porting of these packages directly
after creating a machine configuration file.

Once the basic integration is complete, make sure to enable additional
features, including the firmware not critical for boot, such as
Bluetooth or Wi-Fi firmware. Next, port any applications, and
continue development as needed.

In short, the recommended order is:

1. Machine configuration file
2. SPL and U-Boot proper
3. OP-TEE and TF-A
4. Linux Kernel

.. note::

   It is recommended to use ``DISTRO=lmp-base`` during the porting task.

Next in this guide, each of the steps listed are detailed, focusing on
the recommendations to work with each package. It is important to note
that there are use cases when a board has peculiarities which may not be
listed here, but it is important to understand and cover them during the
port.
