.. _gs-register:

Register your device
====================

Your Linux microPlatform image includes a tool, ``lmp-device-register`` that will
register your device(s) via the Foundries.io REST API.

1. From a console on the device run this command to register the device to your
   factory::

     sudo lmp-device-register -n <device-name>

2. You will be prompted by ``lmp-device-register`` to complete a challenge with
   our API

   .. highlight:: none

   **Example Output**::

     Registering device, test, to factory gavin.
     Device UUID: df1295df-ba58-40a0-9239-542ded5ab934
