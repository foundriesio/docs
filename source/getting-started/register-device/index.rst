.. _getting-started-register:

Register your device
====================

Your Linux microPlatform image includes a tool, ``lmp-device-register`` that will
register your device(s) via the Foundries.io REST API.

1. From a console on the device run this command to register the device to your
   factory::

     lmp-device-register -n <device-name>

2. You will be prompted by ``lmp-device-register`` to complete a challenge with
   our API

   .. highlight:: none

   **Example Output**::

     Registering device, test, to factory stetson.
     Device UUID: df1295df-ba58-40a0-9239-542ded5ab934

       Device Name: df1295ff-ba58-40a0-9239-542bed5ab964
       User code: SQRD-PLBN
       Browser URL: https://app.foundries.io/activate/

3. After completing the previous step, the device is registered and should be
   visible by navigating to the web interface at
   https://app.foundries.io/factories/, clicking your **Factory** and selecting
   the **Devices** tab.

   Or by using :ref:`ref-fioctl`::

     fioctl devices list

Now that you're done, you might want to read :ref:`sec-tutorials` to see some
examples of the things that can be done with your Factory. Additionally, you can
read the :ref:`ref-manual` to learn more about the architecture of
FoundriesFactory and the Linux microPlatform.
