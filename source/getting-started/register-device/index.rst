Registering Your Device
=======================

Your Linux® microPlatform (LmP) image includes the ``lmp-device-register`` tool that manages device registration for your device via the Foundries.io™ REST API.

1. To register a device with your Factory, run the following from the device console:

 .. prompt:: bash device:~$, auto

      device:~$ sudo lmp-device-register -n <device-name> -f <factory>

.. note::
    The parameter ``-f <factory>`` is only needed for the first target.

2. You will be prompted by ``lmp-device-register`` to `complete a challenge <https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/device-flow/>`_ with our API.
   Follow the instruction prompts:

   .. highlight:: none

   .. prompt:: text

     Registering device, test, to factory gavin.

.. note::

    After registration, devices will run **all** applications that are available in the latest Target.
    This default behavior can be changed by enabling only specific applications.
    Read :ref:`ug-fioctl-enable-apps` to learn how.

.. seealso::
   :ref:`Team Based Factory Access <ref-team-based-access>` for permissions related to device management.
