Fioctl CLI Installation
=======================

:ref:`ref-fioctl` is a simple tool that interacts with the Foundries.io REST API
for managing a Factory. It is based on the `ota-lite API
<https://api.foundries.io/ota/>`_, also built by Foundries.io.

:ref:`ref-fioctl`, is used to manage:

- :ref:`Tags (per device, and per Factory) <ref-advanced-tagging>`
- :ref:`Device configuration <ref-fioconfig>`
- :ref:`OTA updates <ref-aktualizr-lite>`
- :ref:`CI Secrets <ref-container-secrets>`

Installation
------------

.. _gs-fioctl-manual-install:

Manual Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We use `Github Releases`_ to distribute static golang binaries. If you don't have a
package manager, are not on a supported distribution, or would prefer to install
manually, you can refer to this section for manual installation instructions.

.. tabs::

   .. group-tab:: Linux

      1. Download a Linux binary from the `Github Releases`_ page to a directory
         on your ``PATH``

         For example, to download version |fioctl_version| on Linux, do:

         .. parsed-literal::

              sudo curl -o /usr/local/bin/fioctl -LO https://github.com/foundriesio/fioctl/releases/download/|fioctl_version|/fioctl-linux-amd64

      2. Make the :ref:`ref-fioctl` binary executable::

           sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/fioctl

      You can execute this again in future to overwrite your binary, therefore
      updating or changing your version.

   .. group-tab:: macOS

      1. Download a Darwin binary from the `Github Releases`_ page to a directory
         on your ``PATH``

         For example, to download version |fioctl_version| on macOS, do:

         .. parsed-literal::

              curl -o /usr/local/bin/fioctl -LO https://github.com/foundriesio/fioctl/releases/download/|fioctl_version|/fioctl-darwin-amd64

      2. Make the :ref:`ref-fioctl` binary executable::

           chmod +x /usr/local/bin/fioctl

      You can execute this again in future to overwrite your binary, therefore
      updating or changing your version.

   .. group-tab:: Windows

      1. Download a Windows binary from the `Github Releases`_ page.
      2. Put it in a folder of your choosing and rename it to ``fioctl.exe``
      3. Press ``Win + R`` and type ``SystemPropertiesAdvanced``
      4. Press ``enter`` or click ``OK``.
      5. Click "Environment Variables..." in the resultant menu..
      6. Click the ``Path`` **system** variable, then click ``Edit...``
      7. Click ``New`` in the "Edit environment variable" menu.
      8. Enter the path to the folder in which you have placed :ref:`ref-fioctl`.

         An example path string if installing to a folder on the desktop would
         look like this.

         ``C:\Users\Gavin\Desktop\fio\bin``

      You should now be able to open ``cmd.exe`` or ``powershell.exe`` and type
      ``fioctl``.

.. _gs-fioctl-package-install:

Via Package Manager
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. tabs::

   .. group-tab:: macOS

      We maintain a brew Formula_

        .. code-block:: shell

           brew tap foundriesio/homebrew-fioctl
           brew install fioctl

   .. group-tab:: Windows

        .. note::
           We recommend using either the WSL_ or Scoop_ to manage your
           :ref:`ref-fioctl` installation.

        **Via Scoop**

        1. Install Scoop_
        2. From Powershell, run::

             scoop bucket add fio https://github.com/foundriesio/scoop-fioctl
             scoop install fioctl

        **Via Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)**

        1. Enable the WSL_
        2. `Install a supported Linux Distribution
           <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10#step-6---install-your-linux-distribution-of-choice>`_
           such as Ubuntu, Debian.
        3. Launch a shell via WSL, usually bash.exe is available from the start
           menu.
        4. You can now follow our docs as if you were running Linux, refer to
           the Ubuntu/Debian installation steps.

   .. group-tab:: Arch Linux

      We maintain an `AUR Package`_

      **Via yay**

        .. code-block:: shell

          yay -S fioctl

      **Or via makepkg**

        .. code-block:: shell

          git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/fioctl-bin.git
          cd fioctl-bin
          makepkg -si

.. _gs-fioctl-post-install:

Post-Install
^^^^^^^^^^^^
Now that :ref:`ref-fioctl` is installed, you must authenticate with our backend
before you're able to use it. This requires you to generate OAuth2 application
credentials for interacting with Factory APIs::

  fioctl login

:ref:`ref-fioctl` will now ask for your API token and walk you through the
authentication process.

.. note:: Tokens can be generated at https://app.foundries.io/settings/tokens

.. tip::

   We recommend creating a new API token for each device you plan to use our
   tools with. For example, if you intend to develop on multiple systems such
   as a laptop and a desktop, you should create a new token for each, just as
   you would with SSH keys. This way you can revoke tokens for individual systems,
   should they be compromised.
