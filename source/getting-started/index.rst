Getting Started
===============

FoundriesFactory includes two ways of getting started.
Most people, such as :ref:`gs-arduino-uno-q` users, will be using a container-only Factory and can follow the steps outlined in the :ref:`ref-gs-container-only` guide.
Other users will be creating a Factory based on the Linux microPlatform and call follow the steps outlined in the :ref:`ref-gs-lmp` guide.
