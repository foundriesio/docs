Getting Started with the LmP
============================

LmP based Factories are available if you want to use the Yocto Project and OSTree.
These Factories produce immutable OS images as well as all the features of a container-only Factory.
 A paid subscription allows you to customize the base image and perform other advanced operations such as firmware updates and secure boot tooling.
