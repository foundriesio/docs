Getting Started with the LmP
============================

LmP based Factories are available for people wanting to use Yocto and OSTree.
These Factories produce immutable OS images as well as all the features of a container-only Factory.
Paid subscriptions allow users to customize this base image and perform other advanced operations such as firmware updates and secure boot tooling.
