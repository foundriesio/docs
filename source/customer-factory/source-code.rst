Factory Source Code
===================

The FoundriesFactory provides you with a private git sandbox which allows you
to maintain and customize your platform.

You will find four git repositories, below is a brief description of each one.

meta-subscriber-overrides.git
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This OE layer defines what is included into your factory image. You can add
board specific customizations and override, add and remove packages provided
in the default Linux microPlatform base.

lmp-manifest.git
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The repo manifest for the platform build. It defines which layer versions
are included in your platform image. The ``default.xml`` file is the latest
released manifest of our Linux microPlatform, and the ``<myfactory>.xml``
includes your factory changes which allows you to customize your image
against our common base.

containers.git
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is where containers and docker-app definitions live. It allows you to
define what containers to build, and how to orchestrate them on the platform.
By default it will build containers for amd64, aarch64, and armhf architectures.

ci-scripts.git
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Defines your platform and container build job to our continuous integration system.

Triggering Builds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you push changes to either ``lmp-manifest.git`` or ``meta-subscriber-overrides.git``,
a new platform build will be triggered, and if successful will deploy the
update to any registered devices.

Any changes pushed to ``containers.git`` will trigger a container build job, and
any containers defined will be pushed to your factoryâ€™s private Docker
registry at:

 :samp:`https://hub.foundries.io/{myfactory}/{mycontainer}:latest`


.. note::

   Commit messages that include ``[skip ci]`` or ``[ci skip]`` will not
   trigger CI builds.
