Managing the Device
===================

The FoundriesFactory provides you the ability to produce your own custom
platform images, and a mechanism to securely deploy them to any of the
registered devices.

A couple of quick notes:

 * The default user and password is ``fio``; we recommend changing it now if you haven’t already.
 * For dynamic host name resolution to work, your local network needs to support Zeroconf and the hostname must be otherwise unclaimed.

Registering the Device with the OTA Server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your Linux microPlatform image includes a tool, ``lmp-device-register`` that
will register your device(s) via Foundries.io REST API.

#. From a console on the device run this command to register the device into your
   factory::

    # -a - this allows you to specify an optional comma separated list of
    #      Docker Apps to manage on the device. Check :ref:`tutorial-containers`
    #      for more information.
    # -n - the name of the device as you'd like it to appear in fioctl and the UI
    sudo lmp-device-register -n device-name-01

#. There will be a challenge that needs to be pasted into the URL printed out
   on the screen. Enter the challenge into the text field on the website.

#. Now your device is registered, and any new platform builds produced will be
   pushed down to this device, and be applied. You can view all the devices
   registered to your factory at: https://app.foundries.io/devices/. You can
   also work with your fleet using the `fioctl command line tool`_.

#. If for some reason you would like to re-provision a device, you will need to
   remove the credentials generated by lmp-device-register, and re-provision
   the device. Using the same device name twice is not supported::

    sudo -s
    systemctl stop aktualizr-lite
    rm -rf /var/sota/*
    lmp-device-register -a shellhttpd -n your_device_name
    systemctl start aktualizr-lite

#. If you would like to monitor the update status on the device, here are a
   couple of useful commands::

    sudo journalctl -f -u aktualizr-lite
    sudo ostree admin status


Managing Device Updates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once registered, a device's updates options can be remotely managed with
``fioctl devices config updates``::

  # Configure the device to run the "shellhttpd" app
  fioctl devices config updates <device> --apps shellhttpd

  # Configure the device to run 2 apps (comma separate the apps)
  fioctl devices config updates <device> --apps app1,app2

  # Configure the device to take updates from the "master" tag:
  fioctl devices config updates <device> --tags master

These updates are handled on the device by the `fioconfig`_ daemon. This
checks for configuration updates on a configurable periodic interval. The
factory default is 5 minutes. So - changes can take up to 5 minutes before
they appear. For more details on tagging see :ref:`ref-advanced-tagging`.
