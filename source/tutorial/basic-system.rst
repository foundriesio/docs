Set Up Basic LWM2M System
=========================

Now that you have installed the :ref:`Zephyr <tutorial-zephyr>` and
:ref:`Linux <tutorial-linux>` microPlatforms, it's time to use them to
set up an end-to-end IoT demonstration system using the OMA
Lightweight M2M (LWM2M) protocol and OpenThread 802.15.4 stack.

A block diagram of this system is shown here. Multiple IoT devices can
connect to the network through the gateway.

   :figwidth: 5in

The system contains Zephyr-based IoT devices, a Linux-based IoT
gateway, and a web application, Leshan, that is used as the LWM2M
server.  With Leshan, you can issue commands, query data, and perform
firmware over the air (FOTA) updates on the IoT device(s).

By default we use the OpenThread stack for gateway to mesh device
communications. We also provide instructions on how to additionally
enable Bluetooth BLE support. However, note that many gateway devices,
including the Raspberry Pi 3, may exhibit unreliability when connecting
to more than several devices using BLE.

Using the demonstration system described here, you can:

- See live data readings from your devices using the Leshan web application.

- Send commands to the device, such as turning on and off an LED.

- Use Leshan to update your IoT device firmware.

For simplicity, this basic system does not secure its network
communications. Instructions in the next page describe how to set up
secure channels using the DTLS protocol.

Prepare the System
==================

Set up IoT Gateway
------------------

We use the Nordic nRF52840 Dongle device to provide 802.15.4 communications
with OpenThread. Follow the `directions`_ on the Nordic web site to program
the Dongle with the OpenThread NCP firmware using the nRFConnect programmer.
A ready to install `binary file`_ is available from Foundries.io. You may
also build this yourself from the github.com OpenThread project. Note that
once installed this dongle may be used on any gateway using the LmP that
supports the reference software including x86 and Arm-based platforms.
Install the programmed Dongle into any of the Raspberry Pi USB ports.

The `gateway-containers`_ project includes a simple `docker-compose file`_
that can start up a minimal set of containers to support this tutorial.
Log into your gateway using SSH and then run::

    git clone https://github.com/foundriesio/gateway-containers.git

    cd gateway-containers
    docker-compose up -d

If you wish to add support for BLE devices then you will also need to run
the following command::

   docker-compose -f docker-compose.ble.yml up -d

You can watch the logs of the containers with::

    # From your gateway-containers directory:
    docker-compose logs -f            # tail logs from all containers
    docker-compose logs -f bt-joiner  # tail logs for a single container

To get a list of running containers, use ``docker ps``.

Your gateway device is now ready for use.

Set up IoT Device(s)
--------------------

First, install the Zephyr microPlatform as described in
:ref:`tutorial-zephyr`.

Then, build and flash the basic LWM2M system's application.

.. important::

   Do not skip the ZmP installation step. Make sure MCUboot is flashed
   on your device!

.. warning::

   The basic application does not have any end-to-end network
   communication security. You can enable DTLS-based security on
   nRF52840 devices using instructions in the next document in this
   tutorial.

By default the system uses 802.15.4 OpenThread mesh for
communications with the nRF52840-DK endpoints(s). However, you
can alternatively use BLE/6LoWPAN. If you use BLE you may see
reduced reliability using the Raspberry Pi as a gateway if you
use more than a few BLE endpoints.

Use the System
==============

Now that your system is fully set up, it's time to check that sensor
data are being sent to the cloud, and do a FOTA update.

Look in your IoT device console for a log line ending in something
like this:

.. code-block:: none

   LWM2M Endpoint Client Name: zmp:sn:deadbeef

Above, the value ``zmp:sn:deadbeef`` is your device's client ID, which
it uses to register with the LWM2M server. Look for that ID in the
clients list at https://mgmt.foundries.io/leshan/#/clients, and click
on it to view available LWM2M objects on your device.

.. note::

   This LWM2M server interface is provided by Foundries.io only for
   ease of use bringing up the system, demonstration and prototyping.
   Availability and uptime are not guaranteed.

Read and Write Objects
----------------------

When a device registers with the Leshan server, Leshan will
automatically render known object types in its web interface.  You can
interact with these objects by clicking the Read, Write, etc. buttons
which appear next to them.

- Read device instance information

  To read general device instance information, scroll down to "Device"
  > "Instance 0" and click the "Read" button as shown in the following
  figure.

  .. figure:: /_static/tutorial/leshan-readinfo.png
     :align: center
     :width: 5in
     :alt: Instance 0 information

     Click on the Read button following "Instance 0".

- Read current state of temperature and light objects

  To read the current status of the temperature and light control
  objects, click the "Read" button next to each "Instance" of these
  objects as shown in the following figure.

  .. figure:: /_static/tutorial/leshan-readtemp-light.png
    :align: center
    :width: 5in
    :alt: Read the light settings in Leshan

    Click on the Read buttons following the instances.

- Change state of the light object

  Click "Write" buttons to bring up interfaces for changing data. An
  example of this interface for the light object is shown here.

  .. figure:: /_static/tutorial/leshan-changelight.png
      :align: center
      :width: 5in
      :alt: Write the light settings in Leshan

      Clicking the On/Off Write button brings up this interface.

Initiate a Firmware Update
--------------------------

It's now time to update the device firmware, using the Firmware Update
object view in Leshan. This involves writing a URI where the firmware
update is hosted to the "Package URI" field for this object. To keep
things simple, you'll "update" the firmware using the same binary you
built previously, but you can also change and rebuild the program
before following these steps to write new firmware.

Start a Python 3 HTTP server on your workstation from the directory
you ran ``west sign`` from earlier (the ZmP root directory)::

  python3 -m http.server

The signed firmware you created will then be available at this URL:

http://YOUR_WORKSTATION_IP:8000/zephyr.signed.bin

To start the firmware update, click the Write button for the "Package
URI" field in the Firmware Update object, then write this value in the
resulting popup, like so.

.. figure:: /_static/tutorial/leshan-packageuri.png
    :width: 5in
    :align: center
    :alt: User interface for setting Package URI

    Set the Package URI field.

Once you click the Update button, the file will begin transferring to
the target.

In general, the Package URI must be hosted where it is routable from
your IoT gateway, so if your workstation and the gateway are on the
same LAN, internal IP addresses should work. The URL scheme can be
either ``coap://`` or ``http://``. Due to firmware restrictions, the
length of the Package URI must be less than 255 characters.

Monitor for a Completed Transfer
--------------------------------

Click the "Observe" button in the State line of the Firmware Update
object:

.. figure:: /_static/tutorial/leshan-observeupdate1.png
    :width: 5in
    :align: center
    :alt: Leshan interface showing State value equal to 1

    Example State observation. Value is 1 (downloading).

The state values and their meanings are:

    * 0: Idle
    * 1: Downloading
    * 2: Downloaded
    * 3: Updating

If you're connected to the device console, progress is logged as
in the following example::

  [00:10:36.893,066] <inf> fota_lwm2m: 85%
  [00:10:39.038,146] <inf> fota_lwm2m: 86%
  [00:10:40.939,575] <inf> fota_lwm2m: 87%
  [00:10:42.889,495] <inf> net_lwm2m_rd_client: Update callback (code:2.4)
  [00:10:42.889,495] <inf> net_lwm2m_rd_client: Update Done
  [00:10:43.084,655] <inf> fota_lwm2m: 88%
  [00:10:44.988,006] <inf> fota_lwm2m: 89%
  [00:10:46.838,653] <inf> fota_lwm2m: 90%

Monitor the transfer until the State value is 2 (Downloaded):

.. figure:: /_static/tutorial/leshan-observeupdate2.png
    :width: 5in
    :align: center
    :alt: Leshan interface showing State value equal to 2

    State value is now 2 (Downloaded).

Download completion is logged on the device console as in the
following example::

  [00:11:04.974,761] <inf> fota_lwm2m: 99%
  [00:11:06.779,937] <inf> fota_lwm2m: 100%

Execute the Update
------------------

After the device has downloaded the update file, initiate the update
by clicking on the "Exec" button on the Update line in Leshan.

The device console logs messages as it resets into the bootloader,
MCUBoot, which will load the new image::

  [00:12:08.061,584] <dbg> fota_lwm2m.firmware_update_cb: Executing firmware update
  [00:12:08.061,614] <inf> fota_lwm2m: Update Counter: current -1, update -1

  starting test - Running Built in Self Test (BIST)

When the update execution is complete, the device will register with
Leshan again.

Congratulations! You've just read and written objects, and done your
first FOTA update using this system. Continue to the next page to
