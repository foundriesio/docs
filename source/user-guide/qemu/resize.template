Image Resizing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If required, the Factory image can be resized for more space available.

Create and resize a ``qcow2`` image:

.. parsed-literal::
   qemu-img create -f qcow2 -F raw -b lmp-factory-image-|MACHINE|.wic |MACHINE|\_device1.qcow2
   qemu-img resize -f qcow2 |MACHINE|\_device1.qcow2 8G

The above example creates and then resizes to 8Gâ€”set to meet your needs.

This requires changes to the script so that:

       * ``file=`` is set as the qcow2 image name, i.e., |MACHINE|\_device1.qcow2
       * ``format=raw`` is replaced with ``format=qcow2``.

So for example, the CLI command to run the resized image is:

.. parsed-literal::
   |QEMU_COW|

.. important::
    Use ``qcow2`` if you wish to change the QEMU disk size, or if you are looking to emulate multiple devices.
    Each image converted and subsequently run with QEMU will be recognized as a distinct device.
