Extending the Linux microPlatform

Adding Packages to the Image
----------------------------

The ``meta-subscriber-overrides.git`` repo allows you to customize the packages included in your factory image.
To do this, you add packages as a list to the variable ``CORE_IMAGE_BASE_INSTALL`` in ``recipes-samples/images/lmp-factory-image.bb``.
For a quick example let us add the ``stress-ng`` utility package to the build:

.. code-block:: bash

  git clone https://source.foundries.io/factories/<myfactory>/meta-subscriber-overrides.git
  vi meta-subscriber-overrides/recipes-samples/images/lmp-factory-image.bb

Add "stress-ng" to the package list::

  vim \
  stress-ng \
  ...

Then::

  git add meta-subscriber-overrides/recipes-samples/images/lmp-factory-image.bb
  git commit -m "add stress-ng package to device image"
  git push

Go and get a coffeeâ€”your Factory is generating a new image with this package.
This can take a half an hour or more.

You can check the status at:

 ``https://ci.foundries.io/projects/<myfactory>/lmp/``

Once completed and the update is applied, the device will reboot.
This behavior is customizable; you can apply rules to determine when devices should restart.
Once restarted, the ``stress-ng`` command will be available.

List of Available Recipes
-------------------------

OE provides a `tool`_ to search layers and recipes.
Remember to set the same branch name used by the current factory version.

Creating a Python3 Package from PyPi
------------------------------------

Some Python packages do not yet have a recipe for python3 in OE.
If this is the case with a desired package, use the template below to add a new package from PyPi.

Create a recipe in the **meta-subscriber-overrides.git** repository using the following naming scheme:

  ``recipes-devtools/python/python3-<package name>_<version>.bb``

  (E.g.: recipes-devtools/python/python3-virtualenv_16.4.3.bb)

Example file contents::

  DESCRIPTION = "Virtual Python Environment builder"
  HOMEPAGE = "https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv"
  SECTION = "devel/python"
  LICENSE = "MIT"
  LIC_FILES_CHKSUM = "file://LICENSE.txt;md5=51910050bd6ad04a50033f3e15d6ce43"

  SRC_URI[md5sum] = "5f012791118fe99990d9422cf560edf3"
  SRC_URI[sha256sum] = "984d7e607b0a5d1329425dd8845bd971b957424b5ba664729fab51ab8c11bc39"

  inherit setuptools pypi

  DEPENDS += " \
        python3-pip \
        "

  RDEPENDS:${PN} += " \
        python3-dateutil \
        "

Using the information and packages from the PyPi website, fill in the details about the new Python package

   Pypi package

Update the following variables to reflect the details for the package you wish to create a recipe for.

#. ``DESCRIPTION``
#. ``HOMEPAGE``
#. ``LICENSE``
#. ``LIC_FILES_CHKSUM``
#. ``SRC_URI[md5sum]`` (md5sum of the download artifact from pypi)
#. ``SRC_URI[sha256sum]`` (sha256sum of the download artifact from pypi)
#. ``DEPENDS`` Dependencies resolved at do_configure
#. ``RDEPENDS`` Dependencies resolved at do_build

Using ``FEATURES`` to Configure LmP
-----------------------------------

Three "features" variables control and configure the build system: ``DISTRO_FEATURES``, ``IMAGE_FEATURES`` and ``MACHINE_FEATURES``.
Each one takes effect in a single aspect of the build system.

.. important::

    When changing ``DISTRO_FEATURES``, the distro changes.
    This results in the rebuilding of packages, which can take a while.

    When changing ``MACHINE_FEATURES``, the hardware description changes.
    This results in a different group of packages installing to the image.

    When changing ``IMAGE_FEATURES``, the image changes.
    This may reflect in the list of packages installed, or in the image configuration.

    Make sure you understand the result of any change.

``DISTRO_FEATURES`` is a list of configurations from a distro that reflects how some packages build or install.
While there is a list of `Yocto Project distro features`_ supported, the list can expand by including other meta layers.
For example, the distro features ``systemd`` or ``wayland`` define the list of packages to install, and configures how some packages build.
The distro feature ``modsign``,along with certificates, signs the kernel modules.

The default value used by LmP is defined in  ``meta-lmp/meta-lmp-base/conf/distro/include/lmp.inc``.
This can be customized by architecture, machine, or any other override.
To customize, use ``DISTRO_FEATURES:append = <value>`` to add a feature, and ``DISTRO_FEATURES:remove = <value>`` to remove one.
To remove a feature from an override list, use ``DISTRO_FEATURES:remove:<machine> = <value>``.

Use the command ``bitbake-getvar`` to see the value of some variables, and all the intermediate values::

  $ bitbake-getvar DISTRO_FEATURES
  NOTE: Starting bitbake server...
  #
  # $DISTRO_FEATURES [7 operations]
  #   :append /lmp/source/main/build-lmp/conf/../../layers/meta-lmp/meta-lmp-base/conf/distro/include/lmp.inc:40
  #     " pam usrmerge virtualization ptest alsa"
  #   :append /lmp/source/main/build-lmp/conf/../../layers/meta-lmp/meta-lmp-base/conf/distro/lmp.conf:18
  #     " sota"
  #   set? /lmp/source/main/build-lmp/conf/../../layers/openembedded-core/meta/conf/distro/include/default-distrovars.inc:20
  #     "${DISTRO_FEATURES_DEFAULT}"
  #   :append /lmp/source/main/build-lmp/conf/../../layers/openembedded-core/meta/conf/distro/include/init-manager-systemd.inc:2
  #     " systemd"
  #   set /lmp/source/main/build-lmp/conf/../../layers/openembedded-core/meta/conf/documentation.conf:144
  #     [doc] "The features enabled for the distribution."
  #   set? /lmp/source/main/build-lmp/conf/../../layers/openembedded-core/meta/conf/bitbake.conf:884
  #     ""
  #   :append[tegra] /lmp/source/main/build-lmp/conf/../../layers/meta-lmp/meta-lmp-bsp/conf/machine/include/lmp-machine-custom.inc:690
  #     " opengl"
  # pre-expansion value:
  #   "${DISTRO_FEATURES_DEFAULT} pam usrmerge virtualization ptest alsa sota systemd"
  DISTRO_FEATURES="acl argp bluetooth ext2 ipv4 ipv6 largefile usbgadget usbhost wifi xattr zeroconf pci vfat modsign efi security tpm integrity seccomp pam usrmerge virtualization ptest
  alsa sota systemd"

Using ``DISTRO="lmp"`` generates the log.
``DISTRO_FEATURES`` can be changed by seven operations, and one of them is for an override (``tegra``).
The log also shows file path and line for each operation.

The line starting with ``DISTRO_FEATURES=`` show the variable value.

The Yocto Project also provides ``IMAGE_FEATURES`` and ``MACHINE_FEATURES``.
These are lists of features for the image and to describe the machine, respectively.
There is also lists of `Yocto Project image features`_ and `Yocto Project machine features`_ supported by the project.

The LmP uses the ``MACHINE_FEATURES`` for a machine to determine if a package gets included.
For example, the OP-Tee package is only included in an image if the target machine includes the feature ``optee`` within ``MACHINE_FEATURES``.

.. _ref-ug-private-repo:

Including Private Git+ssh Repositories
--------------------------------------

Custom recipes may need access to private Git repositories only available via SSH.
The ci-scripts_ repo has logic to handle this when a Factory has secrets created using a simple naming convention.

.. _ci-scripts:
   https://github.com/foundriesio/ci-scripts/blob/master/lmp/bb-build.sh

Secrets matching the pattern ``ssh-*.key`` are loaded into an ssh-agent, and ``ssh-known_hosts`` is used to sets the trusted host keys for the Git server(s).

To generate ``ssh-known_hosts``::

  $ ssh-keyscan github.com > /tmp/ssh-known_hosts

An example for accessing a private GitHub repo::

  $ fioctl secrets update ssh-github.key==/tmp/ssh-github.key
  $ fioctl secrets update ssh-known_hosts==/tmp/ssh-known_hosts

At this point new CI jobs will be able to access recipes that have ``SRC_URI`` items like::

  SRC_URI = "git://git@github.com/<repo>;protocol=ssh;branch=main"
