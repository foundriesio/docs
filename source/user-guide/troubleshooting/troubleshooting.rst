OTA Update Fails Because of Missing SPL Keys
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When updating to a newer base ``lmp-manifest``, your Factory may face issues with OTA upgrades from **v85** to the next release.
It manifests as a failed boot attempt and error in the u-boot log:

.. code-block::

    U-Boot SPL 2021.04+fio+g38c3083e39 (Feb 16 2022 - 14:50:02 +0000)
    power_pca9450b_init
    DDRINFO: start DRAM init
    DDRINFO: DRAM rate 3000MTS
    DDRINFO:ddrphy calibration done
    DDRINFO: ddrmix config done
    Normal Boot
    Trying to boot from MMC2
    SPL: Booting secondary boot path: using 0x1300 offset for next boot image
    ## Checking hash(es) for config config-1 ... fit_config_verify_required_sigs: No signature node found: FDT_ERR_NOTFOUND
    SPL_FIT_SIGNATURE_STRICT needs a valid config node in FIT
    ### ERROR ### Please RESET the board ###

This suggests that the SPL key is missing from the factory.
The key is defined in the OE recipe and it defaults to ``spldev``.

.. prompt::

    UBOOT_SPL_SIGN_KEYNAME="spldev"

This can be confirmed by checking whether files ``spldev.key`` or ``spldev.crt`` are missing from the ``lmp-manifest/factory-keys`` directory.
If so, the easiest fix is to generate the keys and add them to the repository.

.. prompt::

    cd factory-keys
    openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out spldev.key \
          -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048 \
          -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_pubexp:65537
    openssl req -batch -new -x509 -key spldev.key -out spldev.crt

Once the ``spldev.key`` and ``spldev.crt`` are created, add them to the repository.

.. prompt::

    git add factory-keys/spldev.key
    git add factory-keys/spldev.crt
    git commit

Once the commit is pushed upstream, the FoundriesFactory® CI will generate a build that fixes the issue.

Request Entity Too Large Error
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This error occurs when your Factory has accumulated too much Target metadata to be signed by The Update Framework (TUF).
All of your Targets contained in :term:`targets.json` can grow large over time::

Solution
""""""""

Over time, the manual pruning (deletion) of Targets is maintenance you should consider.

Pruning can be done using Fioctl™.
This removes outdated Targets from your Factory's :term:`targets.json`, allowing the production of new Targets.

.. warning::

   Ensure there are no important devices running on a Target that is about to be pruned.
   If you are intending on pruning production tags, be cautious and mindful of what you are doing.

You can prune/delete individual Targets by using their TUF Target name::

  fioctl targets prune <TUF_Target_name>

Or, you can prune by tag, such as ``devel`` or ``experimental``::

  fioctl targets prune --by-tag <tag>

We highly recommend not pruning all Targets from a tag to avoid container builds failing from the lack of platform builds for this tag.
To keep the last ``<number>`` of the Targets from a tag, use::

  fioctl targets prune --by-tag <tag> --keep-last <number>

There is also the ``--dryrun`` option.
This lets you can check the pruned targets before running the actual command::

  fioctl targets prune --by-tag <tag> --keep-last <number> --dryrun

How Tos
--------

Aktualizr-Lite and Fioconfig Polling Time
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Both ``fioconfig`` and ``aktualizr-lite`` poll for new configuration and updates every 5 minutes by default.
It can be helpful to decrease this interval for development purposes.
Following are two ways to achieve this.

Option A: Changing Interval in Runtime
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

1. On your device, create a settings file in the ``/etc/sota/conf.d/`` folder to configure ``aktualizr-lite``.

   .. prompt:: bash device:~$

       sudo mkdir -p /etc/sota/conf.d/
       sudo sh -c 'printf "[uptane]\npolling_sec = <time-sec>" > /etc/sota/conf.d/90-sota-fragment.toml'

2. Next, create a settings file in the ``/etc/default/`` folder to configure ``fioconfig``.

   .. prompt:: bash device:~$

       sudo sh -c 'printf "DAEMON_INTERVAL=<time-sec>" > /etc/default/fioconfig'

3. Restart both services:

   .. prompt:: bash device:~$

       sudo systemctl restart aktualizr-lite
       sudo systemctl restart fioconfig

.. note::
    Make sure to replace ``<time-sec>`` with the expected poll interval in seconds.

Option B: Changing Interval Included in the Build
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

First, configure the **aktualizr-lite** polling interval:

1. Create the ``sota-fragment`` folder in ``meta-subscriber-overrides`` repo:

   .. prompt:: bash host:~$

       cd meta-subscriber-overrides
       mkdir -p recipes-sota/sota-fragment

2. Add a new file under this directory:

   .. prompt:: bash host:~$

        touch recipes-sota/sota-fragment/sota-fragment_0.1.bb

3. Include the content below to the file created in the last step:

   .. code-block:: none

       SUMMARY = "SOTA configuration fragment"
       SECTION = "base"
       LICENSE = "MIT"
       LIC_FILES_CHKSUM = "file://${COMMON_LICENSE_DIR}/MIT;md5=0835ade698e0bcf8506ecda2f7b4f302"

       inherit allarch

       SRC_URI = " \
               file://90-sota-fragment.toml \
       "

       S = "${WORKDIR}"

       do_install() {
               install -m 0700 -d ${D}${libdir}/sota/conf.d
               install -m 0644 ${WORKDIR}/90-sota-fragment.toml ${D}${libdir}/sota/conf.d/90-sota-fragment.toml
       }

       FILES:${PN} += "${libdir}/sota/conf.d/90-sota-fragment.toml"

4. Create another directory under the one we just created so we can supply the source file (``90-sota-fragment.toml``) for the recipe above:

   .. prompt:: bash host:~$

       cd meta-subscriber-overrides
       mkdir -p recipes-sota/sota-fragment/sota-fragment

5. Create the ``90-sota-fragment.toml`` file under this new directory:

   .. code-block::

       [uptane]
       polling_sec = <time-sec>

.. note::
    Make sure to replace ``<time-sec>`` with the expected poll interval in seconds.

6. In the ``recipes-samples/images/lmp-factory-image.bb`` file, include this new package under ``CORE_IMAGE_BASE_INSTALL``.
   For example:

   .. code-block::

       --- a/recipes-samples/images/lmp-factory-image.bb
       +++ b/recipes-samples/images/lmp-factory-image.bb
       @@ -24,9 +24,10 @@ CORE_IMAGE_BASE_INSTALL += " \
            networkmanager-nmcli \
            git \
            vim \
       +    sota-fragment \
          ..."

7. Next, we configure the ``fioconfig`` daemon interval.
   Create the ``fioconfig`` folder in ``meta-subscriber-overrides`` repo

   .. prompt:: bash host:~$

       cd meta-subscriber-overrides
       mkdir -p recipes-support/fioconfig

8. Add a new recipe file, ``fioconfig_git.bbappend``, under this directory and include the following:

   .. code-block:: none

       FILESEXTRAPATHS:prepend := "${THISDIR}/${PN}:"
       SRC_URI:append = " \
           file://fioconfig.conf \
       "

       do_install:append() {
           install -Dm 0644 ${WORKDIR}/fioconfig.conf ${D}${sysconfdir}/default/fioconfig
       }

9. Create another directory under the one we just created so we can supply the source file (``fioconfig.conf``) for the recipe above:

   .. prompt:: bash host:~$

       cd meta-subscriber-overrides
       mkdir -p recipes-support/fioconfig/fioconfig

10. Create the ``fioconfig.conf`` file under this new directory including:

   .. code-block::

       DAEMON_INTERVAL=<time-sec>

.. note::
    Make sure to replace ``<time-sec>`` with the expected poll interval in seconds.

Commit and trigger a new build to include these new changes and have a new polling interval.

Re-Register a Device
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

During development, you may need to re-register the same device.
Follow these steps to do so:

1. Delete the device from the UI ``Devices`` tab or with:

   .. prompt:: bash host:~$

       fioctl device delete <device-name>

2. Stop ``aktualizr-lite`` and ``fioconfig`` on the device:

   .. prompt:: bash device:~#

       systemctl stop aktualizr-lite
       systemctl stop fioconfig.path
       systemctl stop fioconfig.service

3. Delete both ``sql.db`` and ``client.pem`` on the device:

   .. prompt:: bash device:~#

       rm /var/sota/sql.db
       rm /var/sota/client.pem

4. Lastly, perform the registration again.

Tips and Abouts
---------------

Bind Mounting a File Into a Container
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When bind mounting a file into a container, the parent directory needs to be bind mounted.
If a bind mount destination does not exist, Docker will create the endpoint as an empty directory rather than a file.

The Docker documentation on `containers and bind mounting <https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/>`_ is a good place to start if you wish to learn more about this.

.. _ref-troubleshooting_systemd-service:

NXP SE05X Secure Element and PKCS#11 Trusted Application
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are two memory limits to be aware of.
One is the Secure Element's non-volatile memory.
The other is the built-time configurable PKCS#11 Trusted Application (TA) heap size.

When RSA and EC keys are created using the TA, a request is sent to the Secure Element (SE) for the creation of those keys.
On success, a key is created in the SE's non volatile memory.
The public key is then read back from the SE to the TA persistent storage.
Note only a handle to the private key in the Secure Element is provided and stored by the TA.

During that creation process the TA also keeps a copy of the key on its heap.

This means that a system that creates all of its keys during boot may run out of heap before running out of SE storage.

To avoid this issue, configure OP-TEE with a large enough ``CFG_PKCS11_TA_HEAP_SIZE``.
It should allow the client to fill the SE NVM before an out of memory condition is raised by the TA.
This will help avoid a secure world panic.

An experimental way to validate the thresholds is to loop on RSA or EC key creation until it fails.
If there is a panic or a PKCS#11 OOM fault, ``CFG_PKCS11_TA_HEAP_SIZE`` can then be increased as there is still room in the SE NVM to store more keys.

.. _ref-troubleshooting_network-connectivity:

Debugging Network Connectivity
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When debugging network connectivity and access issues, it can be helpful to use ``curl``.
However, LmP does not ship with the command.

Rather than including ``curl`` on the host device, a simple approach is to run it via a Alpine Linux® container.
    docker run --rm -it alpine
    / # apk add curl
    / # curl

Updates To etc
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Files created or modified in ``/etc`` during runtime are not handled by OSTree during an OTA.
For this reason, we suggest setting system-wide configs in ``/usr`` rather than ``/etc`` whenever possible so that these changes are covered by OTA updates.

We suggest managing files that live in ``/etc`` with a systemd service (:ref:`ref-troubleshooting_systemd-service`).
The runtime service should handle the needed updates to the ``/etc`` files.
