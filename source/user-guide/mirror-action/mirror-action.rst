Configuring Automatic Git Mirroring
===================================

This section shows how to configure source code mirroring to FoundriesFactoryÂ®
repositories. This helps to use external private or public ``Git`` repositories,
hosted on services such as GitHub_ or Bitbucket_.

This focuses on setting up GitHub_ Actions and Bitbucket_ pipelines for
mirroring code, but the steps can be adapted for other ``Git`` services.

.. _ug-mirror-token:

Creating Token
--------------

To allow external hosting services to access your FoundriesFactory repository,
you need to create a token.

Create a new `API Token <https://app.foundries.io/settings/tokens/>`_ by
clicking on :guilabel:`+ New Token`.

Complete with a **Description** and the **Expiration date** and select :guilabel:`Next`.

Check the :guilabel:`Use for source code access` box and select your **Factory**.

   Token for source code access

If Bitbucket_ is used, the token generated in the previous step is used as the
``<GIT_ACCESS_TOKEN>`` value.

If GitHub_ is used, convert the token value to a base64 string and save the
output of this command. This is your ``<BASE64_FIO_TOKEN>`` value.

.. prompt:: bash host:~$, auto

   host:~$ echo -n <FIO_TOKEN> | base64 -w0

**Example Output**:

.. prompt:: text

   host:~$ echo -n SQMD1Gx860mPI6jZFlLJLwaCXT5CqAaQi6nEfIfH | base64 -w0
   U1FNRDFHeDg2MG1QSTZqWkZsTEpMd2FDWFQ1Q3FBYVFpNm5FZklmSA==

.. tip::

   ``<BASE64_FIO_TOKEN>`` should end with ``==`` with no carriage return.

Configuring GitHub Repository
-----------------------------

Go to GitHub_ and find the repository you want to mirror.

Click on :guilabel:`Settings`:

.. figure:: /_static/userguide/mirror-action/mirror-action-github-setting.png

   :align: center

   GitHub Settings

Click on :guilabel:`Secrets` and create a new **secret** by clicking on 
:guilabel:`New repository secret`.

.. figure:: /_static/userguide/mirror-action/mirror-action-github-secrets.png
   :width: 900
   :align: center

   GitHub Secrets

The Github_ Action uses the variable ``GIT_ACCESS_TOKEN`` as the token to access 
your Foundries Factory repository.

However, complete the **Name** with ``GIT_ACCESS_TOKEN`` and on **Value** paste 
the ``<BASE64_FIO_TOKEN>`` provided above.

Finally, click on :guilabel:`Add secret`.

Creating Mirror Action
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The FoundriesFactory CI only triggers builds for configured branches. This is 
configured in the ``ci-scripts.git`` repository in the ``factory-config.yml`` file.

Your ``factory-config.yml`` can be inspected by updating the following URL with your ``<FACTORY-NAME>``:

- https://source.foundries.io/factories/<FACTORY-NAME>/ci-scripts.git/tree/factory-config.yml

Under ``lmp:`` and ``containers:`` the group ``tagging:`` shows the configured branches on ``refs/heads/<branch>:``.

**Example**:

.. prompt:: text

    lmp:
      tagging:
        refs/heads/master:
          - tag: master
        refs/heads/devel:
          - tag: devel
    ...
    containers:
      tagging:
        refs/heads/master:
          - tag: master
        refs/heads/devel:
          - tag: devel
    ...

Based on the example, FoundriesFactory CI is configured to trigger new builds 
whenever a new commit is sent on ``master`` or ``devel`` branches. The following 
commands, guides you to mirror the ``master`` branch.

.. note::

    Notice that this example is updating the FoundriesFactory repository ``containers.git``. 
    The same approach can be used to update ``lmp-manifest.git`` and ``meta-subscriber-overrides.git``.

Clone your GitHub repository and enter its directory:

.. note::

    Make sure to update the clone command with your repository URL.

.. prompt:: bash host:~$

    git clone https://github.com/<host>/<repo_name>
    cd <repo_name>

Check out the ``master`` branch.

.. prompt:: bash host:~$, auto

    host:~$ git checkout master

In case you don't have a master branch yet, create one:

.. prompt:: bash host:~$, auto

    host:~$ git checkout -b master

You must store workflow files in the ``.github/workflows/`` directory of your repository.

.. prompt:: bash host:~$, auto

    host:~$ mkdir -p .github/workflows/

Finally, create the file ``mirror.yml`` and make sure you update the ``<FACTORY-NAME>`` with your Factory Name.

.. prompt:: bash host:~$, auto

    host:~$ gedit .github/workflows/mirror.yml

**.github/workflows/mirror.yml**:

.. prompt:: text

      name: Mirroring
      
      on: [push]
      
      jobs:
        to_foundries:
          runs-on: ubuntu-20.04
          steps:
            - uses: actions/checkout@v2
              with:
                fetch-depth: 0
            - uses: foundriesio/mirror-action@master
              with:
                REMOTE: "https://source.foundries.io/factories/<FACTORY-NAME>/containers.git"
                GIT_ACCESS_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GIT_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
                PUSH_ALL_REFS: "false"

.. warning::

    ``PUSH_ALL_REFS`` is **false**. If **true** it synchronizes all branches.

.. warning::

    Make sure you make a backup of any content in your FoundriesFactory repository 
    that you want to preserve as this action can completely replace all branches.

Add the changed files, commit and push to your GitHub_ repository:

      .. prompt:: bash host:~$, auto

          host:~$ git add .github/workflows/mirror.yml
          host:~$ git commit -m "Adding Mirror Action"
          host:~$ git push

Github Action
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once the ``mirror.yml`` is in place on your GitHub_ repository, every change to 
the configured branch will start an Action on GitHub_ to mirror your repository 
to your FoundriesFactory Repository.

You can find the GitHub_ Action by clicking on :guilabel:`Actions`:

   GitHub Action

On that page, you can find the list of Actions as well as inspect each one.

Configuring Bitbucket Repository
--------------------------------

Go to the source repository on Bitbucket_ and click on :guilabel:`Pipelines`:

.. figure:: /_static/userguide/mirror-action/bitbucket-pipelines.png
   :align: center

   Bitbucket Pipelines

Select the ``Starter pipeline``:

.. figure:: /_static/userguide/mirror-action/bitbucket-pipelines-start.png
   :align: center

   Bitbucket Starter Pipeline

Erase the default content and provide the following setup:

.. prompt::

   pipelines:
     default:
       - step:
          name: Mirror to source.foundries.io
          image: alpine/git:latest
          script:
            - git push https://$GIT_ACCESS_TOKEN@source.foundries.io/factories/<factory-name>/<repo-name>.git --all

.. note::
   Make sure to provide the ``GIT_ACCESS_TOKEN`` generated in
   :ref:`ug-mirror-token` and to replace ``<factory-name>`` and ``<repo-name>``.

Click on :guilabel:`Commit file` to enable this pipeline.

After this, every push to the Bitbucket_ repository mirrors all branches to
``source.foundries.io`` and triggers builds for the branches enabled in your
Factory.

.. tip::

   This pipeline can be customized to mirror only specific branches as needed
   for your development.
