Managing your Subscription
==========================

.. hint::
   FoundriesFactory is a DevSecOps platform subscription service.
   Per month or annual plan choices,
   both provide access to all FoundriesFactory features and support.

Subscriptions generally apply per Factory;
if you have *Factories*, you will manage them separately.

Changing your Plan
------------------

From your Factory's page, navigate to the :guilabel:`Plan` tab.
This will be the option farthest to the right.

Factory Upgrade
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you already plan on subscribing, there is an opportunity to do so during Factory creation.
You can also upgrade your Factory anytime during the free trial,
and will be billed after the trial ends.

.. warning::
   Factories are subject to deletion 90 days after a trial or subscription plan has ended.

To continue after the trial has expired,
go to your Factory page's plan tab and click on "Upgrade" under available plans. 
From here enter the required information:
