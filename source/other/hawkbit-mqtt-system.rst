 hawkBit and MQTT Demonstration System
============================================

.. warning:: **Technology demonstration system only**.

             While the system described below works as documented, it
             has important :ref:`limitations
             <hawkbit-mqtt-limitations>` that imply it should
             not be used as-is in production. It may also change
             incompatibly in the future.

Overview
========

This page documents how to set up and use a demonstration system
containing IoT devices and an IoT gateway, which can publish sensor
data from devices to the cloud and perform firmware over the air
(FOTA) updates of the device firmware.

A block diagram of this system is shown here. One or more IoT devices
can connect to the network through the same gateway.

   System block diagram

The system contains Zephyr-based IoT devices, an IoT gateway, a device
management and OTA system running in a container, and integration with
a cloud-based MQTT service.

Using this demonstration system, you can:

- See live temperature readings from your devices appear in the web
  console provided by a cloud MQTT broker, CloudMQTT.

- Upload a cryptographically signed firmware image to a device
  management server, hawkBit.

- Use hawkBit to install a firmware image onto an IoT device via over
  the air update. The device will boot the update after checking its
  cryptographic signature.

.. _hawkbit-mqtt-limitations:

Limitations
===========

The system as implemented has some important limitations, including:

- It does not secure its network communications. The current
  implementation has the IoT device connecting directly to the hawkBit
  and MQTT servers. Securing these communications from end to end
  generally requires use of certificate-based TLS, which imposes
  infeasible resource requirements on current IoT board targets.

- The hawkBit server container is demonstration-grade only, and has
  security issues such as the use of default administrative passwords.

- The IoT device-side hawkBit implementation does not implement the
  complete hawkBit state machine. Features such as cancelling
  requested actions are not supported.

These implementation details imply that the current system should not
be deployed as-is in production.

Prepare Environment
===================

This system has the same :ref:`dependencies <tutorial-dependencies>`
as the one used in the microPlatforms tutorial. We also assume you
have :ref:`installed the microPlatforms <tutorial-installation>` as
described in the tutorial.

Prepare the System
==================

.. _hawkbit-mqtt-cloudmqtt:

Set up CloudMQTT
----------------

Create a `CloudMQTT`_ account if you don't have one already, and sign
in. After you've signed in, `create a new CloudMQTT instance`_ to use
with this system.  The free instance plan is enough to run this demo,
as shown below:

.. figure:: /_static/other/hawkbit-mqtt/cloudmqtt-instance.png
   :align: center
   :alt: CloudMQTT instance creation user interface

   Create an instance for use with this sytem.

Then click on the "Details" button next to the new instance
in your control panel. Record the following information about the
instance:

- CLOUDMQTT_SERVER: the URL of the server
- CLOUDMQTT_USER: the auto-generated username
- CLOUDMQTT_PASSWORD: the auto-generated password
- CLOUDMQTT_PORT: the port to connect to on the server

The information is in your instance's details page as shown:

.. figure:: /_static/other/hawkbit-mqtt/cloudmqtt-details.png
   :align: center
   :alt: CloudMQTT instance creation user interface

   Instance information to collect.

.. _hawkbit-mqtt-gateway:

Set Up the IoT Gateway
----------------------

You'll now use Ansible to set up your IoT gateway to act as a network
proxy for your IoT device to publish sensor data to CloudMQTT, and
fetch updates from hawkBit.

.. |iot-gateway-setup-server| replace:: hawkBit

.. include:: /tutorial/iot-gateway-setup-common.include

- From the ``gateway-ansible`` repository, deploy the gateway
  containers using the CloudMQTT information you recorded
  earlier.

  To set up the IoT gateway for update |version|:

  .. parsed-literal::

     export CLOUDMQTT_HOST=XXX CLOUDMQTT_PORT=XXX
     export CLOUDMQTT_USER=XXX CLOUDMQTT_PASSWD=XXX
      ./iot-gateway.sh -g raspberrypi3-64.local \\
                       -p <your-subscriber-token> -t |docker_tag|

  Providing your subscriber token is necessary so your gateway device
  can log in to the container registry. If you're concerned about
  typing it directly into the terminal, you can set it in the
  environment variable ``REGISTRY_PASSWD`` by any means you find
  sufficiently secure. Similar comments apply to the
  ``CLOUDMQTT_PASSWD`` environment variable.

  If you run into problems, make sure the SSH key used by your device
  is not password-protected.

Your gateway device is now ready for use.

.. _hawkbit-mqtt-hawkbit:

Run hawkBit Container
---------------------

Now run a demonstration-grade hawkBit server on your workstation (not
the gateway).

.. warning::

   This hawkBit container contains an official
   ``hawkbit-update-server`` artifact build from Maven; however, it is
   for **demonstration purposes only**, and should not be deployed in
   production as-is.

   Among other potential issues, the server has an insecure default
   administrative username/password pair. For more information, see
   e.g. the official documentation on `building and running hawkBit`_
   `authentication`_, and `authorization`_.

.. parsed-literal::

   docker run -dit --name hawkbit -p 8080:8080 \\
              hub.foundries.io/hawkbit-update-server:|docker_tag|

This container can take approximately 40 seconds for the application
to start for the first time.

Load hawkBit Web Interface
--------------------------

After running the hawkBit container, visit http://localhost:8080/UI to
load the administrative interface, and log in with the default
username and password (``admin``/``admin``). Your browser window
should look like this:

.. figure:: /_static/other/hawkbit-mqtt/hawkbit-initial.png
   :align: center
   :alt: hawkBit Administrator Interface

.. note::

   For convenience, you may want to adjust the "Polling Time" in the
   "System Config" area. This will instruct your IoT devices to check
   for updates more frequently. The default is 5 minutes; the minimum
   value is 30 seconds.

.. _hawkbit-mqtt-device:

Set Up the IoT Device(s)
------------------------

Build and flash the demonstration application for your board:

.. content-tabs::

   .. tab-container:: nrf52_blenano2
      :title: BLE Nano 2

      .. code-block:: console

         ./zmp build -b nrf52_blenano2 zephyr-fota-samples/dm-hawkbit-mqtt
         ./zmp flash -b nrf52_blenano2 zephyr-fota-samples/dm-hawkbit-mqtt

      .. include:: /tutorial/pyocd.include

   .. tab-container:: nrf52_pca10040
      :title: nRF52 DK (nRF52832)

      .. code-block:: console

         ./zmp build -b nrf52_pca10040 zephyr-fota-samples/dm-hawkbit-mqtt
         ./zmp flash -b nrf52_pca10040 zephyr-fota-samples/dm-hawkbit-mqtt

      Flashing nRF52 DK requires the nRF5x command line tools to be
      installed on your workstation.

   .. tab-container:: nrf52840_pca10056
      :title: nRF52840 DK

      .. code-block:: console

         ./zmp build -b nrf52840_pca10056 zephyr-fota-samples/dm-hawkbit-mqtt
         ./zmp flash -b nrf52840_pca10056 zephyr-fota-samples/dm-hawkbit-mqtt

      Flashing nRF52840 DK requires the nRF5x command line tools to be
      installed on your workstation.

Information for other boards is provided on a best-effort basis below
in :ref:`hawkbit-mqtt-devices`.

Use the System
==============

Now that your system is fully set up, it's time to check that sensor
data are being sent to the cloud, and do a FOTA update.

Cloud Sensor Updates
--------------------

Choose the instance you created for this demo from your `CloudMQTT
instances list`_, then click the "Websocket UI" button to get a live view
of data being sent to the server. You should see new data appear every
few seconds; it will look like this:

.. figure:: /_static/other/hawkbit-mqtt/cloudmqtt-websocket-ui.png
   :align: center

   MQTT messages from BLE Nano 2 appearing in CloudMQTT Websocket UI.

You can now connect other subscribers to this CloudMQTT instance,
which can act on the data.

FOTA Updates
------------

Now let's perform a FOTA update. In the hawkBit server UI, you should
see the board show up in the "Targets" pane. It will look like this:

.. figure:: /_static/other/hawkbit-mqtt/iot-device-target.png
   :align: center

   Board registered with hawkBit.

It's time to upload a firmware binary to the server, and update it
using this UI. We've provided a Python script to make this easier,
which works with either Python 2 or 3.

Run the appropriate command for your board from the Zephyr
microPlatform installation directory:

.. content-tabs::

   .. tab-container:: nrf52_blenano2
      :title: BLE Nano 2

      .. code-block:: console

         python zephyr-fota-samples/dm-hawkbit-mqtt/scripts/hawkbit.py \
                           -d 'BLE Nano 2 Update' \
                           -f build/zephyr-fota-samples/dm-hawkbit-mqtt/nrf52_blenano2/app/zephyr/dm-hawkbit-mqtt-nrf52_blenano2-signed.bin \
                           -sv "1.0" -p "Testing" -n "nrf52_blenano2 update" -t os

   .. tab-container:: nrf52_pca10040
      :title: nRF52 DK (nRF52832)

      .. code-block:: console

         python zephyr-fota-samples/dm-hawkbit-mqtt/scripts/hawkbit.py \
                           -d 'nRF52 DK Update' \
                           -f build/zephyr-fota-samples/dm-hawkbit-mqtt/nrf52_pca10040/app/zephyr/dm-hawkbit-mqtt-nrf52_pca10040-signed.bin \
                           -sv "1.0" -p "Testing" -n "nrf52_pca10040 update" -t os

   .. tab-container:: nrf52840_pca10056
      :title: nRF52840 DK

      .. code-block:: console

         python zephyr-fota-samples/dm-hawkbit-mqtt/scripts/hawkbit.py \
                           -d 'nRF52840 DK Update' \
                           -f build/zephyr-fota-samples/dm-hawkbit-mqtt/nrf52840_pca10056/app/zephyr/dm-hawkbit-mqtt-nrf52840_pca10056-signed.bin \
                           -sv "1.0" -p "Testing" -n "nrf52840_pca10056 update" -t os

Above, 1.0 is an arbitrary version number. If hawkBit is running on a
different machine, use the ``-ds`` and ``-sm`` options. For more help
on using this script, run::

  python zephyr-fota-samples/dm-hawkbit-mqtt/scripts/hawkbit.py -h

You will see an update in the hawkBit UI for the new image:

.. figure:: /_static/other/hawkbit-mqtt/distribution.png
   :align: center

   Distribution Set representing a signed firmware binary.

You'll now update the device. Before doing so, you can connect to its
serial console via USB at 115200 baud to see log messages during the
upgrade (which should be at ``/dev/ttyACM0`` or so on Linux systems).

- Click on the distribution you uploaded, and drag it over the line in
  "Targets" for your IoT Device.

- You'll next need to confirm the action. Click a button towards the
  bottom of your screen labeled "You Have Actions". This should now
  have a "1" at its top right, since you've assigned the distribution
  to your IoT device:

  .. figure:: /_static/other/hawkbit-mqtt/you-have-actions.png
     :align: center

     Click this button.

- A screen will appear. Select "Save Assign" on this screen:

  .. figure:: /_static/other/hawkbit-mqtt/action-details.png
     :align: center

     Choose "Save Assign".

Your IoT devices will poll the hawkBit server periodically and will
fetch the update the next time they poll.

.. note::

   By default, devices wait five minutes between polls. If you don't
   want to wait, just power cycle the IoT device; the
   ``dm-hawkbit-mqttt`` application checks for updates shortly after
   booting.

While hawkBit is waiting for the device to download and install the
update, a yellow circle will appear next to it in the targets list:

.. figure:: /_static/other/hawkbit-mqtt/iot-device-waiting.png
   :align: center

   Waiting for board to update.

If you're connected to the device's serial console, look for output
like this while the update is being downloaded::

  [0730950] [fota/hawkbit] [INF] hawkbit_ddi_poll: Valid action ID 1 found, proceeding with the update

  [... etc.]

Finally, when the update is installed, the device will reset and
MCUBoot will load the new image, which will initialize itself::

At this point, the yellow circle will turn into a green check box:

.. figure:: /_static/other/hawkbit-mqtt/iot-device-ok.png
