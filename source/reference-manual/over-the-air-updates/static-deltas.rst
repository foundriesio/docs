OSTree Static Deltas
====================

OSTree is implemented as a `Content Addressable Storage`_ system
inspired by Git. Both systems organize their objects in a tree-based
hierarchy. The client's job is to work through these trees of objects
and apply the correct changes. While Git has `smart protocol`_,
OSTree `does not`_. This can lead to certain types of OTAs being
really inefficient - the client will be requesting a large number
of files via HTTP requests.

OSTree has a solution for this problem called static deltas. OSTree
can produce static deltas that are good balance between number
of files to download and the size of each file. For instance,
a 1.5G OTA might be split up into about 38 files that are each
about 30Mb.

Generating static deltas
------------------------
Fioctl includes a command to help generate static deltas. Since
these deltas can sometimes require a bit of processing power and
network bandwidth, the actual work is performed as CI Job in
the Factory.

Understanding what static deltas are needed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
An operator will be planning an update to a new Target. This Target
will have been produced by CI and already have a tag that was used
by CI devices. For example, the targets.json might include::

  "raspberrypi4-64-lmp-9" : {
    "custom" : {
      "version": "9",
      "tags" : ["master"],
   ...

In this example, Target #9 has passed CI and needs to be deployed to
devices following the ``promoted`` tag. The operator can determine
what static deltas are needed by running:

.. prompt:: bash host:~$, auto

   host:~$ fioctl targets static-deltas --dryrun --by-tag promoted 9
    Dry run: Would generated static deltas for target versions:
    7 -> 9
    5 -> 9

In this case, fioctl has looked at all the devices configured to the
``promoted`` tag and found the Target versions they are running,
Target #5 and Target #7. So, to produce the most efficient OTAs,
two static deltas need to be created.

Creating the static deltas
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Running the same command without ``--dryrun`` will produce the
static deltas via a CI Job:

.. prompt:: bash host:~$, auto

   host:~$ fioctl targets static-deltas --by-tag promoted 9

Once the static deltas are in place, Target #9 can be re-tagged so
that "promoted" devices will apply the update:

.. prompt:: bash host:~$, auto

   host:~$ fioctl targets tag --tags master,promoted --by-version 9

When the CI job completes, devices on the promoted tag will start
performing OTA updates that will use the static deltas.
