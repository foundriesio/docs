   Ensure you replace ``<factory>`` with the name of your Factory.

#. Download the necessary files from ``https://app.foundries.io/factories/<factory>/targets``:

     b. Expand the **run** in the :guilabel:`Runs` section which corresponds with the name of the board.
        **Download the Factory image for that machine**, e.g., ``lmp-factory-image-<machine-name>.rootfs.wic.gz`` or ``lmp-base-console-image-<machine-name>.rootfs.wic.gz``.
