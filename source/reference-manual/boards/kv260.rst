#. Ensure that the power code is disconnected.

#. Connect the Micro-USB cable to the ``J4`` connector for serial console
   output.

Flashing QSPI Boot Images
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The SoM Starter Kits use a two stage boot process:

- The primary boot firmware is pre-installed at the factory on the QSPI device.

- The secondary boot device is an SD card containing the Linux kernel and
  system root.

The Xilinx Starter Kit carrier card hardware design sets and factory-locks
the MPSoC boot mode to QSPI32. The SoM boots up to U-Boot using the QSPI
contents and U-Boot then does a hand-off to the secondary boot device.
To replace the boot image on QSPI device with LmP boot images, they have to be
manually flashed to QSPI using pre-installed U-Boot bootloader shell, which
will be automatically booted on the first boot:
::

    > sf probe; setenv bootseq 1; mmc dev ${bootseq};
    > fatload mmc ${bootseq}:1 ${loadaddr} boot0001.bin;
    > sf update ${loadaddr} 0x200000 ${filesize};
    > sf update ${loadaddr} 0xF80000 ${filesize};
    > fatload mmc ${bootseq}:1 ${loadaddr} u-boot0001.itb;
    > sf update ${loadaddr} 0x300000 ${filesize};
    > sf update ${loadaddr} 0x1080000 ${filesize};
    > reset

After reboot, LmP U-Boot serial output is shown:

::

Recovery
--------

If boot images are eventually corrupted, Kria KV260 Vision AI Starter Kit
provides a Image Recovery application. The Image Recovery application is a
baremetal application that uses a web-browser-user interface. It is
invoked when the FW-update (``FWUEN``) button is pressed at power-on,
or automatically, when both image A and image B becomes un-bootable.
It can be used to directly update the A/B images and persistent register
states.

Read the `Boot Firmware Image Recovery`_ page for more details on this
application.
