API Access
==========

`User tokens`_ provide a way to interact with Foundries.io APIs.
Tokens allow users to access:

 * `REST APIs`_. Access is granted by passing the HTTP
   header ``OSF-TOKEN: <token>``.
 * `Git repositories`_. Access is granted by passing a token as the
   password to Git clone and fetch operations.
 * `Factory containers`_. Access is granted by passing a token as the
   password to ``docker login hub.foundries.io``.
 * Fioctl uses Application Credentials for OAuth2 access to APIs.

All tokens are created with scopes to help limit what they can do.

Common scopes
-------------

Some common scopes users may find handy include:

 * ``source:read-update`` - Useful for Git.
 * ``targets:read, devices:read, ci:read`` - read-only access
   for fioctl or REST API
 * ``targets:read-update, devices:read-update, ci:read`` - read-update
   access for fioctl.
 * ``containers:read`` - Useful for running docker commands on
   factory containers.

Token Scopes
------------

Scopes define what resources a given token may perform operations on. The
following scopes are supported:

source:read
 Can perform git clone/fetch/pull operations.
source:read-update
 Can perform git push operations.
source:delete
 Can delete a reference (git push --delete ...) and force-push (git push -f).
source:create
 Can create a new references (tags and branches).

containers:read
  Can docker pull.
containers:read-update
 Can docker push.

ci:read
 Can access CI builds `https://api.foundries.io/projects/<factory>/lmp/`.
ci:read-update
 This isnâ€™t needed normally because ``source:read-update`` triggers CI.
 However, certain custom use-cases that trigger CI builds via
 `https://api.foundries.io/projects/<factory>/lmp/builds/` can use this.

devices:read
 Can view device(s) `https://api.foundries.io/ota/devices/`.
devices:read-update
 Can update configuration on a device
 `https://api.foundries.io/ota/devices/<device>/config/`
devices:create
 Can create a device (lmp-device-register with an API token).
devices:delete
 Can delete a device `https://api.foundries.io/ota/devices/<device>/`

targets:read
  Can view targets.json `https://api.foundries.io/ota/factories/<factory>/targets/`.
targets:read-update
  Can update targets.json `https://api.foundries.io/ota/factories/<factory>/targets/`.
