Network Debugging
=================

This page provides information on debugging network related issues on the LinuxÂ® microPlatform (LmP).

Using tcpdump
-------------

The LmP base image includes a ``tcpdump`` binary at ``/usr/sbin/tcpdump``.
This is used for capturing traffic and diagnosing issues.
Note that ``/usr/sbin`` is not part of the :envvar:`PATH` environment for the base image user, and you must run ``tcpdump`` as root.

Capturing Bluetooth 6lo Network Traffic
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your LmP device is acting as a gateway to IoT devices connected via a Bluetooth link, you may want to restrict the capture to the traffic exchanged between those IoT devices.

To do this, use ``-i bt0`` when invoking ``tcpdump``:

.. code-block:: console

   $ sudo /usr/sbin/tcpdump -i bt0

Note that if you only have one such device, the network interface will be torn down by the kernel if the Bluetooth link is lost.
When that happens, you'll see a message like this from ``tcpdump``:

.. code-block:: none

   tcpdump: pcap_loop: The interface went down

If you want to continue to capture traffic on ``bt0`` for a Bluetooth device that resets and reconnects,
have another device remain connected to your LmP gateway for the duration of the capture.

Capturing LAN Network Traffic
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you're using Ethernet, use ``-i eth0`` to view traffic exchanged with the rest of the LAN:

.. code-block:: console

   $ sudo /usr/sbin/tcpdump -i eth0

You can use ``-i wlan0`` for wireless traffic.

Other Network Interfaces
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To view a complete list of network interfaces you can use with the ``-i`` option, run:

.. code-block:: console

   $ ip link show

One of these may be useful to capture traffic on a network device created for use with containers.

Capturing to a File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It can be convenient to capture traffic in a file for later analysis, such as with Wireshark.
Using ``-w file.pcap`` when invoking ``tcpdump`` will save to a file named ``file.pcap``.
For example, to capture traffic exchanged over the ``bt0`` interface to a file ``bt0.pcap``:

.. code-block:: console

   $ sudo /usr/sbin/tcpdump -i bt0 -w bt0.pcap

To capture to file and view the text simultaneously, use a pipeline like this:

.. code-block:: console

   $ sudo /usr/sbin/tcpdump -i bt0 -U -w - | tee bt0.pcap | sudo /usr/sbin/tcpdump -r -
