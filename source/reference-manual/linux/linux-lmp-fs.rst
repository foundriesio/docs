LmP File Structure
==================

LmP uses the `OSTree`_ upgrade system to cover platform updates.
This brings a modified file system structure, which is detailed on this page.
Also covered here are some related tips about LmP structure, and OTA behavior.

OSTree File System Structure

OSTree brings a **read-only** file system, where the disk partition is ``/sysroot``.
The root that mounted at ``/`` (as above) is ``/sysroot/ostree/deploy/lmp/deploy/<sha>``.

.. warning::
   Some folders should not be manipulated in order to ensure proper behavior of OTA.
   The ``/usr`` path is an example of a critical folder that is mounted as read-only and should not be touchedâ€”this is handled by the LmP OTA.

Persistent Storage
------------------

These folders are treated like persistent storage on the device and have particularities with regards to updates:

* ``/var``

   * Main persistent storage, writable directory.

   * Most important files are located under ``/var`` (see :ref:`ref-linux-lmp-fs-important-files`).

   * Not covered by OTA.

* ``/etc``

   * Covered by OTA if untouched.

   * As soon as OSTree detects a change in this directory, it performs a 3-way merge using the old default configuration, the active system's ``/etc``, and the new default configuration.
     This is then no longer covered by OTA.

   * For the reason above, we do not recommend nor support setting system configurations in this directory. It is more reliable to set critical configurations under ``/usr/lib`` as that is always covered by OTA.

Important Files and Folders
---------------------------

* ``/var/sota``: Stores critical OTA files.

.. prompt::

   # ls -l /var/sota/
   total 208
   -rw-r--r-- 1 root root    692 Aug  1 15:41 client.pem
   drwxr-xr-x 3 root root   4096 Aug  1 15:44 compose-apps
   -rw-r--r-- 1 root root    265 Aug  1 15:49 current-target
   drwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 Aug  1 15:41 import
   -rw-r--r-- 1 root root    227 Aug  1 15:41 pkey.pem
   drwxr-xr-x 4 root root   4096 Aug  1 15:42 reset-apps
   -rw-r--r-- 1 root root    668 Aug  1 15:41 root.crt
   -rw-r--r-- 1 root root    885 Aug  1 15:41 sota.toml
   -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 180224 Aug  1 15:49 sql.db

``/var/sota/sota.toml``: Stores relevant OTA information, like Tag, Apps, custom configurations, certificates location and server address.

``/var/sota/reset-apps``: Holds preloaded apps if :ref:`ug-restorable-apps` are used (default since LmP **v85**).

``/var/sota/compose-apps``: Apps are extracted to this location during app loading.
It holds preloaded apps if Compose Apps are used.

``/var/sota/current-target``: Brings valuable information about the current Target running on the device, including LmP and containers information.
This is populated after the first OTA.

.. prompt::

   # cat /var/sota/current-target  
   TARGET_NAME="qemuarm64-secureboot-lmp-116"
   CUSTOM_VERSION="<target>"
   LMP_MANIFEST_SHA="9f288aba55d140786360a71f773a098d1aa0a4fd"
   META_SUBSCRIBER_OVERRIDES_SHA="dfd11d7e00db24641bd88c2d9d680c38ba5fdf19"
   CONTAINERS_SHA="459e19cde44e17b17054b0cd972f0520cd214f58"
   TAG="<tag>"

``/var/sota/sql.db``: Device registration database.

``/var/sota/client.pem``, ``/var/sota/pkey.pem``, and ``/var/sota/root.crt``: Device registration certificates.
If available, ``client.pem`` and ``pkey.pem`` can be stored in an HSM rather than on files.

* ``/var/lib/docker``: Stores Docker images and containers.

* ``/var/rootdirs/home/fio/``: Home directory.

* ``/etc/os-release``: Provides LmP information, including platform Target number, Tag, and release.
  It does not include information on Target containers.

.. prompt::

   # cat /etc/os-release 
   ID=lmp
   NAME="Linux-microPlatform"
   VERSION="4.0.11-116-91"
   VERSION_ID=4.0.11-116-91
   PRETTY_NAME="Linux-microPlatform 4.0.11-116-91"
   HOME_URL="https://foundries.io/"
   SUPPORT_URL="https://support.foundries.io/"
   DEFAULT_HOSTNAME="qemuarm64-secureboot"
   LMP_MACHINE="qemuarm64-secureboot"
   LMP_FACTORY="<factory-name>"
   LMP_FACTORY_TAG="<tag>"
   IMAGE_ID=lmp-factory-image
   IMAGE_VERSION=<os-target>

.. hint::
   Version information reads as ``VERSION=<Yocto Project version> - <Target number> - <LmP release tag>``


Tips and Suggestions
--------------------

* A :ref:`systemd service <ref-troubleshooting_systemd-service>` can be used if case a file in a directory not covered by OTA needs to be updated.

* It is recommended to store custom user files under ``/var/local``.
  Keep any custom files location in mind when implementing a :ref:`ref-factory-device-reset`.

* The full initial Target information (includes containers and LmP) just after the provisioning of a device can be checked with:

.. prompt::

   # cat /var/sota/import/installed_versions | grep "\"version\""
      "version": "102",

After the first OTA, it can be read in ``/var/sota/current-target`` as discussed previously.

* If enabling :ref:`ref-linux-persistent-log`, ``/var/log`` is used to store system logs.
  It is recommended to mount it in an additional storage so it does not take valuable internal storage space which could impact the OTA behavior.
