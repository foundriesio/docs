Linux microPlatform
===================
The Foundries.io Linux microPlatform is an extensible
software and hardware platform that makes it easier to develop,
secure, and maintain Internet-connected Linux-based embedded devices.

The Linux microPlatform is based on `OpenEmbedded`_ / `Yocto Project`_, and adds a
select set of board support package layers to enable popular
development boards.

Though the `Linux kernel`_ and software used for
any of the microPlatform builds may contain out-of-tree patches or
features, a fundamental goal is to run as close to the tip, or latest
software, as possible so that users of the Linux microPlatform can
benefit from the latest changes.

In a FoundriesFactory, the Linux microPlatform is the baseline software
stack which is meant to be extended by the user. It is open source software,
and maintained by Foundries.io on `GitHub`_.
