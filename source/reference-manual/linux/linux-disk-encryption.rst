Disk Encryption Support
=======================

To strengthen the security of system deployments prior to manufacturing,
LmP uses LUKS disk encryption.

During the image creation process in CI, LmP can be configured to use
LUKS to construct a symmetrically encrypted root file-system. The master
key used for data encryption is protected and unlocked using a
passphrase.

.. code-block:: console

  OSTREE_OTA_EXT4_LUKS = "1"

The LmP default configuration is to have this feature disabled.

Regardless of whether the file system was originally encrypted by CI or
not, this passphrase will be discarded. The file system will then be
re-encrypted on the target device as follows.

Upon the initial boot, during initramfs, the passphrase used for
accessing the master key is discarded and replaced by a cryptographic
key. Since this key is used to protect the master key, it is known as
the Key Encryption Key (KEK).

LmP uses LUKS which uses Systemd to register the new KEK. The KEK is an
RSA 2048 asymmetric key, with the key pair being generated via either a
TPM 2.0 or a PKCS#11 security token. This also ensures the secure
storage of the key information.

By enrolling the KEK this way, the system gains the capability of
unlocking the volume seamlessly, without requiring any user involvement.

Once the KEK has been enrolled, LmP marks the :term:`rootfs` volume for disk
`re-encryption`_, mounts it and allows the system to continue with the
boot sequence. This is know in LUKS terminology as ``online
re-encryption``.

As part of the regular boot procedure, a systemd service will initiate
the data re-encryption process in the background; this process is
non-blocking and allows the rest of the system to continue initializing.

Upon completion of the re-encryption, the service also creates and
stores a backup of the LUKS2 header. This backup image is stored in the
primary partition and serves as a safeguard, enabling the booting of
systems in cases where their disk headers may have been damaged.

.. note::

  If the system is restarted before the non-blocking re-encryption
  service has finished, the subsequent boot will be **blocked in
  initramfs** until the root file system has been fully encrypted.


Prerequisites
-------------

To ensure that the disk encryption and decryption processes can be
carried out without human intervention, LmP mandates the presence of
either PKCS#11 or TPM 2.0 controlled devices on the target hardware.

Devices controlled via PKCS#11 or TPM 2.0 interfaces can therefore be
utilized to securely store and provide the Key Encryption Key (KEK).

Storing the KEK is achieved through the use of LUKS2 tokens, making use
of either the **systemd-pkcs11** or **systemd-tpm2** plugins (refer to
`systemd-cryptenroll`_ for additional details).

In ARM System on Chips (SoCs), a common PKCS#11 scenario is to execute
OP-TEE within the TrustZone. In this setup, OP-TEE should be configured
to use the eMMC Replay Protected Memory Block (RPMB) for secure storage
with tamper-resistant properties.

In TPM 2.0 devices and as a security enhancement, we require that UEFI
boots with secure boot be enabled. This is because the KEK is linked to
the Platform Configuration Register 7 (PCR 7), which monitors the
**secure boot state of the machine**.

We demonstrate both of these scenarios using QEMU in the sections below.

Enabling Support for Disk Encryption
------------------------------------

The following options require customizations for disk encryption support:

For adding the required ``initramfs-module-cryptfs`` module to the initramfs (based on what gets provided by ``MACHINE_FEATURES``, like ``tpm2`` or ``optee``):

.. code-block:: none

  DISTRO_FEATURES:append = " luks"

For splitting the ``/boot`` content from the ostree deployment in a separated partition (where kernel/initramfs gets stored, unencrypted).
This option is enabled by default on systems booting with UEFI support:

.. code-block:: none

  OSTREE_SPLIT_BOOT = "1"

For supporting the copying of content from ``/usr/lib/ostree-boot`` (used for boot firmware updates) to ``/boot``, as part of the ostree deployment step (OTA).
This is required for supporting boot firmware updates on devices with encrypted root file systems:

.. code-block:: none

  OSTREE_DEPLOY_USR_OSTREE_BOOT = "1"

For supporting ``/boot`` being in a separated partition at the final image the selected ``WKS_FILE`` needs to support split boot.
UEFI based devices already have such setup by default, but on most ARM/ARM64 devices a custom WKS might be required.
As an example, iMX8-based devices should use ``sdimage-imx8-spl-split-boot-sota.wks.in`` instead of the default ``sdimage-imx8-spl-sota.wks.ini`` file:

.. code-block:: none

  WKS_FILE:sota:mx8mm-nxp-bsp = "sdimage-imx8-spl-split-boot-sota.wks.in"

.. note::

  Along with a custom ``WKS_FILE`` for split boot support, also update the target fstab to automatically mount ``/boot`` (from the first partition).
  This is not required with UEFI-based systems, as systemd is capable of automatically identifying and mounting the ESP partition during boot.

Implementation Details for OP-TEE PKCS#11 Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A dedicated slot is required to avoid conflicts with the PKCS#11 token slot normally used by ``aktualizr-lite``.
This dedicated slot is currently hardcoded to slot 1, with the label ``lmp``.

During the encryption process the token slot is initialized and a RSA 2048 key is generated, which is later used by `systemd-cryptenroll`_.

Make sure to **not** erase the token slot or the key during the lifetime of the image.
Doing so would cause the system to fail at boot.
A recovery key can be created and provided manually if required, but it will not be an unattended boot.

Testing TPM 2.0 Support With Qemu (x86) and swtpm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is possible to test the disk encryption support with TPM 2.0 with QEMU and `swtpm`_.

Make sure LUKS support is enabled for your x86 target:

.. code-block:: console

  $ cat meta-subscriber-overrides/conf/machine/include/lmp-factory-custom.inc
  DISTRO_FEATURES:append:intel-corei7-64 = " luks"

Now install ``swtpm`` on the host machine, and start the ``swtpm`` daemon.
This will be consumed by QEMU and act as the hardware TPM.

.. code-block:: console

   $ mkdir -p /tmp/mytpm
   $ while true; do swtpm socket --tpmstate dir=/tmp/mytpm --ctrl type=unixio,path=/tmp/mytpm/swtpm-sock --tpm2; done;

Run QEMU with the required extra TPM 2.0 related commands:

.. code-block:: console

  $ qemu-system-x86_64 -device virtio-net-pci,netdev=net0,mac=52:54:00:12:35:02 \
      -netdev user,id=net0,hostfwd=tcp::2222-:22 \
      -object rng-random,filename=/dev/urandom,id=rng0 -device virtio-rng-pci,rng=rng0 \
      -drive if=none,id=hd,file=lmp-factory-image-intel-corei7-64.wic,format=raw \
      -device virtio-scsi-pci,id=scsi -device scsi-hd,drive=hd \
      -drive if=pflash,format=qcow2,file=ovmf.secboot.qcow2 -no-reboot \
      -nographic -m 1024 -serial mon:stdio -serial null -cpu host -enable-kvm \
      -chardev socket,id=chrtpm,path=/tmp/mytpm/swtpm-sock \
      -tpmdev emulator,id=tpm0,chardev=chrtpm -device tpm-tis,tpmdev=tpm0


On the first boot, enroll the :ref:`UEFI Secure Boot Certificates <ref-secure-boot-uefi>` to enable secure boot support. This is required as the LUKS2 TPM 2.0 token leverages **PCR 7**, which tracks the secure boot state.

To do this, select the UEFI Secure Boot systemd-boot menu as described in :ref:`UEFI Secure Boot Provisioning <ref-secure-boot-uefi-provisioning>`. The system will reset. Then run **the same command** again.

You should see the following during this second boot:

.. code-block:: none

  ...

.. note::

   As long as the TPM 2.0 emulation storage is not deleted, you will be
   able to reboot your QEMU image since the key will persist.


Implementation Details for OP-TEE PKCS#11 Support
-------------------------------------------------

To prevent conflicts with the PKCS#11 token slot utilized by
``aktualizr-lite``, a dedicated slot is necessary.

LmP will set this dedicated slot as **slot 1** with the label ``lmp``.

Before initiating the re-encryption process, the slot is initialized,
and a new **RSA 2048** key is generated. This key never leaves the
PKCS#11 domain.

It is important to emphasize that only the **encrypted master key** is
stored in the LUKS JSON token header area.

Please ensure that you **DO NOT** erase the PKCS#11 token slot or its key
throughout the lifespan of your product. Failure to follow this
precaution will result in the system's inability to boot.

In the event of such a scenario, a recovery key can be created and
provided manually, but it won't support an unattended boot process.


Testing PKCS#11 Support With Qemu (arm64)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Make sure LUKS support is enabled for your ``qemuarm64-secureboot`` target:

.. code-block:: console

  $ cat meta-subscriber-overrides/conf/machine/include/lmp-factory-custom.inc
  DISTRO_FEATURES:append:qemuarm64-secureboot = " luks"


When running QEMU, please be cautious not to exceed 2GB of memory usage,
as attempting to use more than 2GB of memory may prevent the OP-TEE
emulation from successfully booting. So, it's advisable to stay within
this memory limit.

.. code-block:: console

  $ qemu-system-aarch64 -m 2048 -cpu cortex-a57 -no-acpi -bios flash.bin \
      -device virtio-net-device,netdev=net0,mac=52:54:00:12:35:02 -device virtio-serial-device \

      -object rng-random,filename=/dev/urandom,id=rng0 -device virtio-rng-pci,rng=rng0 \
      -chardev null,id=virtcon -machine virt,secure=on -nographic

You can also examine the PKCS#11 slot created by OP-TEE to verify the
presence of the RSA-2048 key mentioned earlier:

.. code-block:: none

  root@qemuarm64-secureboot:/var/rootdirs/home/fio# pkcs11-tool --module /usr/lib/libckteec.so.0 --list-token-slots
  Available slots:
  Slot 0 (0x0): 94e9ab89-4c43-56ea-8b35-45dc07226830
    token state:   uninitialized
  Slot 1 (0x1): 94e9ab89-4c43-56ea-8b35-45dc07226830
    token label        : lmp
    token manufacturer : Linaro
    token model        : OP-TEE TA
    token flags        : login required, PIN pad present, rng, token initialized, PIN initialized
    hardware version   : 0.0
    firmware version   : 0.1
    serial num         : 0000000000000001
    pin min/max        : 4/128
  Slot 2 (0x2): 94e9ab89-4c43-56ea-8b35-45dc07226830
    token state:   uninitialized

.. note::

   The OP-TEE PKCS#11 secure storage emulation  will NOT survive across
   reboots. As a consequence of this, because the root file system
   was encrypted, the system will encounter a failure in mounting the
   root file system during the subsequent boot.


If you were to reboot the system under the described circumstances, you
should expect to encounter the following error:
