Repo Primer for Linux microPlatform
===================================

This section describes `Repo`_ and how the Linux microPlatform uses
it. If you're unfamiliar with Repo, it may make things clearer.

A Linux microPlatform build tree installation contains multiple Git
repositories, which are managed by a *manifest file* in a Repo
*manifest repository*.

The manifest repository's name is ``lmp-manifest``. It's a Git
repository, just like any of the source code repositories. In
:ref:`ref-linux-building`, `repo init`_ is given the URL for the
manifest repository.

The manifest repository contains a manifest file, named
``default.xml``.  This file describes the other Git repositories in
the Linux microPlatform installation, and their metadata. During
installation, `repo sync`_ is run after ``repo init``. This clones the
other repositories according to the contents of the manifest.

Roughly speaking, the manifest file contains:

- *remotes*, which specify where Linux microPlatform repositories are
  hosted.
- *projects*, which specify the Git repositories that make up the
  microPlatform, along with the remotes to fetch them from, and Git
  branches to check out.
