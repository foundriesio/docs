Adding Packages to the Image
----------------------------
The **meta-subscriber-overrides.git** repo allows you to customize the
packages included in your factory image.

Add packages to the list for ``CORE_IMAGE_BASE_INSTALL`` located in
**recipes-samples/images/lmp-factory-image.bb**.

For a quick example letâ€™s add the "stress-ng" utility package to the build.::

  git clone https://source.foundries.io/factories/<myfactory>/meta-subscriber-overrides.git
  vi meta-subscriber-overrides/recipes-samples/images/lmp-factory-image.bb

If the git clone fails with an unable to access error then check you have a
valid token in your ``.netrc`` file. You can look at
:ref:`sec-learn` for instructions.

Add "stress-ng" to the package list.::

  vim \
  stress-ng \
  ...

Then::

  git add meta-subscriber-overrides/recipes-samples/images/lmp-factory-image.bb
  git commit -m "add stress-ng package to device image"
  git push

Go and get a coffee - your Factory is generating a new image with this package.
This will take at least half an hour (and maybe longer depending on current Factory capacity).

You can check the status at:

 https://ci.foundries.io/projects/<myfactory>/lmp/

Once completed, the device will reboot after the update is applied. This
behavior is customizable so that you can apply rules to determine when
devices should be re-started.  Once restarted the stress-ng command will
be available.

List of Available Recipes
-------------------------
OE provides a tool_ to search layers and recipes.

Creating a Python3 Package from PyPi
------------------------------------
There are python packages which do not yet have a recipe for python3 in OE.
If this is the case with a desired package, use this template below to add a
new package from PyPi.

Create a recipe in the **meta-subscriber-overrides.git** repository using the
following naming scheme:

  ``recipes-devtools/python/python3-<package name>_<version>.bb``

  (E.g.: recipes-devtools/python/python3-virtualenv_16.4.3.bb)

Example file contents::

  DESCRIPTION = "Virtual Python Environment builder"
  HOMEPAGE = "https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv"
  SECTION = "devel/python"
  LICENSE = "MIT"
  LIC_FILES_CHKSUM = "file://LICENSE.txt;md5=51910050bd6ad04a50033f3e15d6ce43"

  SRC_URI[md5sum] = "5f012791118fe99990d9422cf560edf3"
  SRC_URI[sha256sum] = "984d7e607b0a5d1329425dd8845bd971b957424b5ba664729fab51ab8c11bc39"

  inherit setuptools pypi

  DEPENDS += " \
        python3-pip \
        "

  RDEPENDS:${PN} += " \
        python3-dateutil \
        "

Using the information and packages at the PyPi website, you can fill in the details about the new python package

   Pypi package

Update the following variables to reflect the details from the package you wish to create a recipe for.

#. ``DESCRIPTION``
#. ``HOMEPAGE``
#. ``LICENSE``
#. ``LIC_FILES_CHKSUM``
#. ``SRC_URI[md5sum]`` (md5sum of the download artifact from pypi)
#. ``SRC_URI[sha256sum]`` (sha256sum of the download artifact from pypi)
#. ``DEPENDS`` Dependencies resolved at do_configure
#. ``RDEPENDS`` Dependencies resolved at do_build

Including Private Git+ssh Repositories
--------------------------------------

Sometimes custom recipes need access to private Git repositories that
are only available via SSH. The ci-scripts_ repository has logic to
handle this when a Factory has secrets created using a simple naming
convention.

.. _ci-scripts:
   https://github.com/foundriesio/ci-scripts/blob/master/lmp/bb-build.sh

Every secret matching the pattern ``ssh-*.key`` will be loaded into an
ssh-agent and ``ssh-known_hosts`` will be used to set the trusted
host keys for the Git server(s).

For example, a private GitHub repository could be accessed with::

  $ fioctl secrets update ssh-github.key==/tmp/ssh-github.key
  $ fioctl secrets update ssh-known_hosts==/tmp/ssh-known_hosts

At that point new CI jobs will be able to access recipes that have
``SRC_URI`` items like::

  SRC_URI = "git://git@github.com/<repo>;protocol=ssh;branch=main"
