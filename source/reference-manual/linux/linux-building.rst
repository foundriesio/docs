Building from Source
====================

This is a guide for building the base Linux microPlatform (LmP) from source
for Raspberry Pi 3 (64-bit). Additional information specific to other
targets is provided in :ref:`ref-linux-supported`.

This guide assumes the reader is familiar with basic concepts of
OpenEmbedded. It is not meant to be an introduction to the
OpenEmbedded / Yocto Project. If you're just getting started, it's
strongly recommended to begin with the documentation provided in
:ref:`ref-linux-building-ref`.

 .. note::

  Locally built images are useful for local development, testing and
  for hardware enablement, but are not meant to be updated via OTA.
  For OTA support we recommend creating your own Factory and using
  our continuous integration system.

.. _ref-linux-building-hw:

Get Hardware
------------

You will need a x86 computer to develop on; Linux is currently
natively supported. On macOS and Windows, see
:ref:`ref-linux-dev-container` for information on setting up a
containerized Linux build environment.

You will also require at least 50GB of storage for a complete Linux
microPlatform build.

Set Up Build Environment
------------------------

On Debian-based Linux distributions, including Ubuntu, run::

   $ sudo apt-get install coreutils gawk wget git-core diffstat unzip \
       texinfo g++ gcc-multilib build-essential chrpath socat cpio \
       openjdk-11-jre python2.7 python3 python3-pip python3-pexpect xz-utils \
       debianutils iputils-ping libsdl1.2-dev xterm libssl-dev libelf-dev \
       android-tools-fsutils ca-certificates repo whiptail

.. note::

   If you are running Ubuntu 18.04, make sure to enable the universe
   repository by adding following line to your
   :file:`/etc/apt/sources.list`:

   .. code-block:: none

      deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ bionic universe

On other Linux distributions, please check the `Yocto Project Quick
Start Guide`_ for additional guidance.

.. _ref-linux-building-install:

Install the Linux microPlatform
-------------------------------

Download the meta layers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Linux microPlatform sources can be placed in any directory on your
workstation, as long it provides enough disk space for the complete
build. This uses the `Google Repo`_ tool to fetch a variety of Git repositories
at known-good revisions, and keep them in sync as time goes on.

#. Make an installation directory for the Linux microPlatform, and
   change into its directory::

     mkdir lmp && cd lmp

   (You can also reuse an existing installation directory, or ``/build/lmp``
   if building inside the lmp-sdk container, as described at :ref:`ref-linux-dev-container`)

#. Install update |version| using repo:

   .. parsed-literal::

      repo init -u https://github.com/foundriesio/lmp-manifest -b |manifest_tag|
      repo sync

Set up Work Environment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Next, set up your work environment for building the source.

The supported ``MACHINE`` target used by this guide is
``raspberrypi3-64``. (For information on other hardware platforms, see
:ref:`ref-linux-supported`.)

The default distribution (``DISTRO``) is automatically set to ``lmp``,
which is provided by the meta-lmp-base layer (see
:ref:`ref-linux-layers` for more details).

Set up your work environment using the ``setup-environment`` script::

  MACHINE=raspberrypi3-64 source setup-environment [BUILDDIR]

If ``MACHINE`` is not provided, the script will list all possible
machines found in every enabled OpenEmbedded / Yocto Project layer,
and force one to be selected.

``BUILDDIR`` is optional; if it is not specified, the script will default to
``build-lmp``. Keep in mind that ``BUILDDIR`` must be within the ``lmp``
directory, otherwise your build will fail.

Build the lmp-base-console Image
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can build the Linux microPlatform base-console image by running::

  bitbake lmp-base-console-image

.. note::

   Depending on the amount of RAM and number of processors and cores
   in your system, the speed of your Internet connection, and other
   factors, the first build could take several hours. Subsequent
   builds run much faster since some artifacts are cached.

At the end of the build, your build artifacts will be found under
``deploy/images/raspberrypi3-64``. The artifact you will
use to flash your board is
``lmp-base-console-image-raspberrypi3-64.wic.gz``.

Install the lmp-base-console Image
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you're using a Raspberry Pi 3, you can use the same procedure outlined in
:ref:`gs-flash-image`. See :ref:`ref-linux-supported` for additional information
on other targets.

Install the LmP for your FoundriesFactory
-----------------------------------------

In case you are already working with a FoundriesFactory,
you can instead download the source code for that factory
with the following steps.

1. Make an installation directory for the LmP for that ``<factory-name>``,
   and change into its directory::

     mkdir <factory-name> && cd <factory-name>

2.  Install the ``<factory-name>`` meta layers using repo:

   .. parsed-literal::

      repo init -u https://source.foundries.io/factories/<factory-name>/lmp-manifest.git -b devel -m <factory-name>.xml
      repo sync

   The manifest ``<factory-name>.xml`` refers to all the LmP meta layers
   and also to the ``<factory-name>`` specific repositories
   as described :ref:`ref-factory-sources`.

3.  Build the image for ``<factory-name>``:

   .. parsed-literal::

      MACHINE=<machine-name> source setup-environment [BUILDDIR]
      bitbake lmp-factory-image

   The variable ``MACHINE`` should
   be set to a supported machine.
   see the current available option
   in :ref:`ref-linux-supported`.)

   ``BUILDDIR`` is optional;
   in case it is not provided,
   script default is ``build-lmp``.

   ``lmp-factory-image`` is the suggested default image,
   and can be customized with the steps from :ref:`ref-adding-packages-image`.

   It is worth remembering that the ``bitbake`` step can take a while.

   At the end of the build,
   your build artifacts is found under
   ``deploy/images/<machine-name>``.
   The artifact you use to
   flash your board is
   ``lmp-base-console-image-<machine-name>.wic.gz``.

.. warning::

   The local build of your FoundriesFactory is great for
   developing and debugging
   and the results can be used on the host machine
   or deployed to a hardware board.

   However, the image created locally is
   not yet visible for the OTA system,
   and is only available for local use.

   When you push the changes to the
   FoundriesFactory git repositories
   and trigger a new build
   you can flash and register your device
   following the instructions of
   :ref:`gs-flash-device`
   and :ref:`gs-register`.
   This way you can take full advantage of OTA system.
