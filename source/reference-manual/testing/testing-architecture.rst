Architecture Overview
=====================

The Factory includes a generic :ref:`API and data model <ref-fiotest>`
to allow customers the freedom to test how they choose. In most cases,
you'll be able to use fiotest as-is for your testing needs.

All things in the Factory revolve around Targets and the testing
mechanism is no different. Devices run Targets. The results of any
tests they run are correlated with its Target. This allows you to get
a test reporting of Targets in your Factory.

The fiotest container can be set up in your Factory as a
:ref:`Docker Compose application <ref-compose-apps>`. The fiotest
container has the ability to interact with the host OS and configure
aktualizr-lite to notify it when a new Target has been installed.
fiotest is then able to run tests and report the results back through
the :ref:`device gateway <ref-ota-architecture>`.

fiotest includes a `test specification`_ that allows you to define
how and what to test. The container can also be extended/customized
for your specific needs.

Workflow
~~~~~~~~

The way testing typically flows:

 * Customer pushes code (``git push``)
 * CI builds a new Target
 * aktualizr-lite will see this new Target and:

   * Installs Target
   * Notifies fiotest once the Target becomes active

     * Tests are run and results are reported via the device gateway
       for the Target.
