Device Testing
==============

The Factory includes a simple, but effective way to manage automated testing.
It's managed by a feature called the Device Gateway Testing API. This API
allows registered devices to report the results of tests. The Factory makes
the raw results of these tests available through api.foundries.io. Fioctl
also includes the ability to summarize test results.

The Model
---------

The API is built around a generic model for recording test results::

  Test:
    Name: string - "ltp"
    Target: string - "raspberrypi3-64-lmp-8"
    Device: string - device uuid
    Status: string - PASS/FAIL/RUNNING
    CreatedOn: timestamp - when the test was started
    CompletedOn: timestamp - when the test was finished
    Details: raw text - could be a summary or test failure details

    # An optional listing of Test Results for when granular details are needed.
    Results: [
      {
        Name: string - "statx"
        Status: PASS/FAIL/SKIPPED
        Metrics: dict[str, float] optional int - if thereâ€™s a meaningful measurement for the test
        Details: raw text - could be the text to the failure
      }...
    ]

The API
-------

POST /tests/
~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Create a new test (``status=RUNNING``)::

    # Content-type: application/json
    {
      "name": "test-name",
      "target": "raspberrypi3-64-lmp-8"
    }
    # The CreatedOn value will be auto-populated by the server.

  **RETURNS**: A location to the new Test object::

    HTTP 201
    LOCATION: /tests/12345

PUT /tests/<test id>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Complete a test with data::

    # Content-type: application/json
    {
      "status": PASS/FAIL
    }

    or

    {
      "results": [
        {"name": "test-1", "status": "PASS"},
        {"name": "test-2", "status": "SKIPPED"}
      ]
    }
    # The CompletedOn value will be auto-populated by the server. If results
    # are provided PASS/FAIL will be based on their values.

  **RETURNS**: ``HTTP 200``

Creating Custom Tests
---------------------

The fiotest_ project provides a good starting point and example of how to
do device testing.
