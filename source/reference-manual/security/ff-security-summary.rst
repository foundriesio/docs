The Hardware Root of Trust depends on the SoC used.
Please refer to :ref:`ref-secure-boot` pages and
to the vendor reference manual for more information.

Secure Online Keys for Boot Stack
---------------------------------

The exact list of keys used for the boot stack depends on the hardware used.
Some platforms will not make use of all keys.
