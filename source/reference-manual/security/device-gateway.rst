Managing Your Device Gateway
============================

LmP devices connect to OTA services via a
:ref:`device gateway <ref-ota-architecture>` configured with
mutual TLS. Each factory uses a default device gateway with
certificates owned by Foundries.io. We allow and **encourage**
you to set up your own PKI infrastructure so that you are in control
of the security of the device gateway.

Terminology
-----------

.. _Root-of-trust:

Root of trust - factory_ca.key / factory_ca.pem
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The PKI root of trust for your factory. You own the private key
(EC prime256v1 by default). The corresponding x509 certificate is shared
with Foundries.io to define your root of trust.

All intermediate CA and mutual TLS certificates configured in your factory  must be signed
by this keypair. In particular, the certificates listed below.

.. _tls-crt:

Server TLS Certificate - tls-crt
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This certificate along with its private key is used by Device Gateway
during mTLS handshake/session setup.
Specifically, they are used for Device Gateway identity verification by a device/client
and a TLS session's symmetric key setup.
The private key is owned by Foundries.io and the certificate is signed by the root of trust.

.. _online-ca:

"online-ca"
~~~~~~~~~~~

In order for ``lmp-device-register`` to work, Foundries.io needs the
ability to sign client certificates for devices. If enabled, the
root of trust will sign an ``online-ca`` certificate that Foundries.io can use
to sign client authentication certificates.

.. _local-ca:

"local-ca"
~~~~~~~~~~
Optional pair(s) of a private key and intermediate CA certificate signed by the root CA that can be used by something like your
manufacturing process sign client certificates for devices without needing access to Foundries.io.

It is also known and referred as ``offline CA`` since a user owns its private key and keeps it "offline".

Setting up your PKI
-------------------

:ref:`ref-fioctl` includes a sub-command to set this up:
``fioctl keys ca create /absolute/path/to/certs/``. A few important things to
note about this command:

 * It's highly recommend that you use a PKCS#11 compatible HSM. This
   will ensure the safety of your factory's root of trust private key.

 * The "PKI Directory" is important and should be securely backed
   up.

You can view the configured certificates with
``fioctl keys ca show --pretty``.

The Factory PKI is interwoven with Device Manufacturing Process and Device Registration,
you can find out more details on this topic in this guide :ref:`ref-factory-registration-ref`.

More details on Device Gateway PKI can be found in this :ref:`guide <ref-device-gateway-pki-details>`.
