Aktualizr-Lite
==============

The default OTA client shipped with the LinuxÂ® microPlatform is ``aktualizr-lite``.
This client is a build variant of the Aktualizr project.
It is for those who wish to have the security aspects of TUF, but without the complexity of Uptane.

There are two modes ``aktualizr-lite`` supports.

Daemon Mode (Default)
---------------------

This is the default mode of ``aktualizr-lite`` in the Linux microPlatform.
The daemon will only be enabled in a Factory after ``lmp-device-register`` has successfully registered your device.
The daemon periodically checks for new updates, and applies them when found.

To disable daemon mode:

``sudo systemctl disable aktualizr-lite``

To enable daemon mode:

``sudo systemctl enable aktualizr-lite``

To restart the daemon:

``sudo systemctl restart aktualizr-lite``

To stop the daemon:

``sudo systemctl stop aktualizr-lite``

To view the daemon logs:

``sudo journalctl -f -u aktualizr-lite``


.. note:: If ``aktualizr-lite`` default daemon mode does not fit your needs, the alternative is :ref:`ug-custom-sota-client`.

Configuration
-------------

Configuration Update Methods
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Editing ``/var/sota/sota.toml`` on a device
* Adding or editing an existing configuration snippet, e.g. ``/etc/sota/conf.d/z-50-fioctl-01.toml`` on a device
* Running ``fioctl devices config <device>`` from a host.
  See :ref:`ref-configuring-devices` for more details.

Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~

The following are aktualizr-repo's configuration parameters that can be useful to modify.
The presented values are the default ones.

.. code-block::

    [uptane]
    # Target/Update check-in interval
    polling_sec = 300

    [pacman]
    # A comma separated list of Compose Apps to update
    compose_apps = ""

    # Compose Apps root directory
    compose_apps_root = "/var/sota/compose-apps"

    # Prune/Delete unused docker containers and images
    docker_prune = "1"

    # A comma separated list of Tags to look for in Targets that should be applied to a given device
    tags = "master"

    # The param instructs aktualizr-lite to (re-)create App containers of a new Target just before reboot if set to "1" (default).
    # If the param is set to "0" then the App containers are (re-)created just after a successful boot on a new ostree version during aklite startup.
    create_containers_before_reboot = "0"

    # A percentage of an available storage that can be used by Compose Apps.
    # aktualizr-lite checks whether there is enough storage available before performing OTA update of Compose Apps.
    # min(sizeof(AppsV_N+1) - sizeof(AppsV_N), 0)  <  <available_storage> * <storage_watermark>/100
    # storage_watermark value has to be between 20 and 95
    # By default, if the configuration param is not specified, it is set to "80".
    storage_watermark = "60" (set to "80" if not specified)

    [logger]
    # Set log level 0-5 (trace, debug, info, warning, error, fatal)
    loglevel = 2

    [bootloader]
    # A command to invoke after an ostree repo update in order to reboot a system and apply the update
    reboot_command = "/bin/true"
