Summary
-------
In this tutorial, we configured a device dynamically with the ``fioctl`` command.
Keep in mind that you can send more than one file to the device, allowing you to 
configure more than one application.
This configuration file feature can be associated with a ``device group``, 
allowing you to update not just one device but a group of devices.
