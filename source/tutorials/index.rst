Tutorials Overview
==================

The following tutorials will help familiarize you with the workflow for your Factory.
As the concepts build upon others, follow them sequentially.

.. important::
   The tutorials assume you have followed the Getting Started and that you have a :ref:`registered device <gs-register>`.

   Make sure you have ``git`` and :ref:`Fioctl <gs-install-fioctl>` installed on your host machine.
   ``QEMU`` is also required if it is set in your Factory.

:ref:`tutorial-gs-with-docker` introduces ``docker-compose`` apps.
Next is :ref:`tutorial-creating-first-target` —learning what a :term:`Target` is through experience is key to using your Factory.

Then you will learn how devices consume Targets with :ref:`tutorial-deploying-first-app`.

:ref:`tutorial-configuring-and-sharing-volumes` introduces ways to configure devices.

:ref:`tutorial-compose-app` provides more in depth experience creating Apps.

If you need to make changes on your device outside running containers,
learning about :ref:`tutorial-customizing-the-platform` is vital.

Learning about :ref:`tutorial-working-with-tags` assists with development workflow.

For further instructional reading,
the :ref:`User Guide <user-guide>` covers common tasks and settings for your Factory.

For advanced use cases and technical details, see the :ref:`Reference Manual <ref-manual>`.
