Summary
-------

This tutorial shows how to use tags to deploy specific versions on the device.

Note that all the instructions from this tutorial were moving the device running 
**Target** into a forward-only flow.

It's important to understand that because adding or removing tags from **Targets** or from devices
could cause unexpected behaviors to the device. The suggestion is to keep your device
moving forward and do not update to earlier versions.
