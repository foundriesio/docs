Summary
-------

This tutorial introduced you to using tags to deploy specific Target versions on a device.

Note that all the instructions from this tutorial were moving the device running Target into a forward-only flow.
This is important because adding or removing tags from Targets or devices could cause unexpected behaviors in the device.
The suggestion is to keep your device moving *forward* and do not update to earlier versions.
