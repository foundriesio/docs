Find Your Build
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once your changes to the :term:`containers.git` repository were pushed, the FoundriesFactoryâ„¢ Platform CI automatically started a new ``container-main`` build.
Go to https://app.foundries.io, select your Factory and click on :guilabel:`Targets`:

The latest **Target** named :guilabel:`containers-main` should be the CI job you just created.

   FoundriesFactory Targets

The status of the new Target will be :guilabel:`queued` or :guilabel:`building`, depending on how recently you pushed the changes.
Click anywhere on the Target's line in the list to see more details.

Your Factory is configured by default to build your container for ``armhf``, ``arm64``, and ``amd64``.
If you select the :guilabel:`+` signal in a :guilabel:`building` architecture you will be able to see the live build log:

When the FoundriesFactory CI finishes all your builds, it will launch a final job to publish your images.

.. tip::

   At this point, the CI job creates a new **Target**.

If all the builds finish without error, the **Target** is created and published and everything will be marked as :guilabel:`passed`.

If you reload the :guilabel:`Target` page, it will indicate new available :guilabel:`Apps`.
