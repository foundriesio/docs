Configure your device
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

At this point, your device should be registered to your Factory according to 
the :ref:`Getting Started guide <gs-register>`. Once registered, two services start to 
communicate with your Factory: ``aktualizr-lite`` and ``fioconfig``.

**aktualizr-lite**:

This is the daemon responsible for updating the device. It checks for new updates and 
implements `The Update Protocol (TUF) <TUF_>`_ to guarantee the integrity of platform 
and container updates. 

**fioconfig**:

This is the daemon responsible for managing configuration data for your device. 
The content is encrypted in a way that only the device will be able to decrypt 
and use.

Both applications are configured to communicate with your Factory.
That being said, an update could take up to 10 minutes to be triggered. 
This can be configured according to your product needs.

To improve your experience during this tutorial, you will configure both 
``aktualizr-lite`` and ``fioconfig`` to check every minute.

This configuration will only apply to the device where the commands below are run. 
To change the timing for the entire fleet, you will need to customize your Factory image.

On your device, create a settings file in the ``/etc/sota/conf.d/`` folder to 
configure ``aktualizr-lite``:

.. prompt:: bash device:~$

    sudo mkdir -p /etc/sota/conf.d/
    sudo bash -c 'printf "[uptane]\npolling_sec = 60" > /etc/sota/conf.d/z-01-polling.toml'

Next, create a settings file in the ``/etc/default/`` folder to configure ``fioconfig``:

.. prompt:: bash device:~$

    sudo bash -c 'printf "DAEMON_INTERVAL=60" > /etc/default/fioconfig'

Restart both services:

.. prompt:: bash device:~$

    sudo systemctl restart aktualizr-lite
    sudo systemctl restart fioconfig

.. tip::

   In the following instructions, you will disable and enable services. 
   This will trigger ``aktualizr-lite`` tasks that might be interesting to follow.

   To watch the ``aktualizr-lite`` logs and see the updates, leave a device 
   terminal running the command:

   .. prompt:: bash device:~$

       sudo journalctl --follow --unit aktualizr-lite
