Checking App State
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This page outlines the implementation of App status reporting and how to check the state of Apps running on a device.

The update agent running on a device inquires Docker Engine about the state of App containers, processes response, and sends a states summary to Device Gateway.
The state inquiry happens periodically, always before checking for an update.
The :ref:`aktualizr-lite parameter <ref-aktualizr-lite-params>` ``polling_sec`` defines the interval for an update check, it is responsible for the App state inquiry interval as well.

``aktualizr-lite`` reports a state summary:

- only if it has changed since the last check
- directly after device reboot
- when ``aktualizr-lite`` restarts.

.. Important:: The FoundriesFactory backend stores just the last 10 states.

If enabled, container health can get determined by a `health check`_ script.
Otherwise container health gets deduced from a container state and exit code.
A healthy container is one in either a ``running`` state or a ``exited`` state with exit code equal to zero.
An App state is *healthy* only if its each container/service is *healthy*.

View a summary of App state using the ``fioctl devices show <device name>`` command.
The output lists *healthy* and *unhealthy* Apps. For example:

.. prompt:: text

        fioctl devices show 58e6e47d-3d2c-415b-afa4-cdc5e0229355

Inspect the reported states by running the ``fioctl devices apps-states <device name>`` command.
The command prints the last reported state of the Apps by default. To output more states, use the ``-n/--limit`` flag.

The output uses the following template:

::

    Time: <timestamp when an Apps state was captured on device, in RFC3339 format>
    Ostree: <ostree commit hash that device's rootfs is based on>

    Unhealthy Apps: <following is a list of *unhealthy* Apps>
        <app-name>:   ["uri": <a pinned App URI, optional>]
                <service-name>:
                    "URI": <a pinned service image URI>
                    "Hash": <a service hash>
                    "Health": <a service container health reported by Docker Engine or deduced from its state>
                    "State": <a service container state reported by Docker Engine>
                    "Status": <a service container status reported by Docker Engine>,
                    "Logs": <last 5 lines of logs yielded by a service container, optional, present only if a container is unhealthy>

    Healthy Apps: <following is a list of *healthy* Apps>
        ...

.. prompt:: text

        fioctl devices apps-states 58e6e47d-3d2c-415b-afa4-cdc5e0229355

Also, by enabling Event Queue for a Factory, you can subscribe for App state change events.
The event type for an App state is ``DEVICE_OTA_APPS_STATE_CHANGED``. See :ref:`Event Queues <ref-event-queues>` for more details.
