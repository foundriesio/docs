Docker Compose Apps
===================

This is the file structure responsible for creating the Docker Compose App:

.. code-block:: none

     └── containers
         └── shellhttpd
             └── docker-compose.yml

The combination of a top-level directory containing ``docker-compose.yml``
will end-up in a Docker Compose App.

The ``docker-compose.yml`` file specifies one or more containers to run and their configurations.
In addition, the Compose App directory can contain complementary files, such as configuration files, volume data, scripts, etc.
The overall maximum allowed size of the Compose App directory is 1 GB.

Foundries.io Hub as Source
--------------------------


Dockerfile in the Same Folder
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In ``shellhttpd``,  the ``docker-compose.yml`` file specifies the Docker 
container image from the Foundries.io hub, ``hub.foundries.io/${FACTORY}/shellhttpd:latest``.
Here, the Docker container image is generated by the ``Dockerfile`` in the ``shellhttpd`` folder.

.. code-block:: none

     └── containers
         └── shellhttpd
             ├── docker-compose.yml
             └── Dockerfile

``shellhttpd/docker-compose.yml``:

.. code-block:: yaml

     services:
       httpd:
         image: hub.foundries.io/${FACTORY}/shellhttpd:latest

Dockerfile in a Different Folder
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Docker container image can also come from a different application created in ``containers.git``. 
This is common when you have a Docker container image used by multiple Docker Compose Apps.

For example:

.. code-block:: none

     └── containers
         ├── app
         │   └── docker-compose.yml
         └── grafana
             └── Dockerfile

In this case, ``app/docker-compose.yml`` looks like this:

``app/docker-compose.yml``:

.. code-block:: yaml

     services:
       dashboard:
         image: hub.foundries.io/${FACTORY}/grafana:latest

External Hub as Source
-----------------------

A Docker Compose App can specify a Docker container image from an external host.
A good example is images from `Docker Hub. <https://hub.docker.com/>`_

For example:

.. code-block:: none

     └── containers
         └── mosquitto
             └── docker-compose.yml

In this case, ``app/docker-compose.yml`` file looks like this:

``app/docker-compose.yml``:

.. code-block:: yaml

     services:
       mosquitto:
         image: eclipse-mosquitto:1.6.12

Multiple Sources
----------------

You can also mix the examples for both single and multiple container applications.
For example:

.. code-block:: none

     └── containers
         ├── shellhttpd
         │   ├── docker-compose.yml
         │   └── Dockerfile
         └── grafana
             └── Dockerfile


In this case, ``shellhttpd/docker-compose.yml`` specifies three different Docker container images:

``app/docker-compose.yml``:

.. code-block:: yaml

     services:
       httpd:
         image: hub.foundries.io/${FACTORY}/shellhttpd:latest
       dashboard:
         image: hub.foundries.io/${FACTORY}/grafana:latest
       mosquitto:
         image: eclipse-mosquitto:1.6.12

- ``httpd``: A Docker container image created from the same ``shellhttpd`` folder.
- ``dashboard``: A Docker container image created from the ``grafana`` folder.
- ``mosquitto``: The mosquitto Docker container image from ``hub.docker.com``.
