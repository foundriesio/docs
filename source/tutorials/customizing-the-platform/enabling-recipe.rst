Enabling the App
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After creating the systemd service recipe, it is important to install the package to the image.

In ``meta-subscriber-overrides`` is  ``recipes-samples/images/lmp-factory-image.bb`` with the variable ``CORE_IMAGE_BASE_INSTALL``.

To install a package to the image, append this variable with the package name.

For this example, add ``shellhttpd`` and ``netcat``.
As the LinuxÂ® microPlatform does not include ``curl``, let us include ``curl`` as well.

.. tip::
   This tutorial installs curl as a package to illustrate how packages can be added to the platform.
   In practice, you can also install ``curl`` as a :ref:`container <ref-troubleshooting_network-connectivity>`.
   Installing as a container rather than directly on the platform may be simpler and take less time.

Edit ``recipes-samples/images/lmp-factory-image.bb`` and append ``CORE_IMAGE_BASE_INSTALL``:

.. prompt:: bash host:~$, auto

    host:~$ cd ..
    host:~$ gedit recipes-samples/images/lmp-factory-image.bb

.. prompt:: text
