Dockerfile
^^^^^^^^^^

The first file you will use is the ``Dockerfile``. Enter the ``shellhttpd`` folder and move the 
``Dockerfile`` from ``shellhttpd.disabled`` to ``shellhttpd``:

.. prompt:: bash host:~$

    cd shellhttpd
    mv ../shellhttpd.disabled/Dockerfile .

The ``Dockerfile`` contains all the commands a user would call on the command line to assemble 
a container image.

A ``Dockerfile`` usually starts from a base image. The base image could be a distribution such as 
Alpine, Debian, or Ubuntu or it could be a distribution already prepared for a specific 
application like Python, NGINX.

Think of the ``Dockerfile`` as your way of customizing the base image.

.. tip::

   For more information, see the `Dockerfile Reference <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/>`_

Check the content of your ``Dockerfile``:

.. prompt:: bash host:~$, auto

    host:~$ cat Dockerfile

**Dockerfile**:

.. prompt:: text

      FROM alpine
      COPY httpd.sh /usr/local/bin/
      CMD ["/usr/local/bin/httpd.sh"]

This ``Dockerfile`` is very simple and a great way to get started. 

The first line creates a layer from the latest 
`Alpine Docker image <https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine>`_. 
This means that your final image contains all the files 
provided by this image plus your additions.

Your first customization is in the second line. ``COPY`` adds files from your Docker clientâ€™s 
current directory to your Docker image. In this case, you will copy the shell script 
``httpd.sh`` to the ``/usr/local/bin/`` directory of your Docker image.

Last but not least there is ``CMD``, these are arguments for the ``ENTRYPOINT``. In this example, 
there is no ``ENTRYPOINT`` specified because the default entrypoint is enough.

The default entrypoint is ``/bin/sh -c`` and by passing ``/usr/local/bin/httpd.sh`` as ``CMD`` you 
are configuring the image to execute the command line: ``/bin/sh -c  /usr/local/bin/httpd.sh`` 
when you run the container.
