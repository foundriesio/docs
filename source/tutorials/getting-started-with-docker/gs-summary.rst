Summary
-------
You have learned the basic commands and structure of Docker and ``docker-compose``
applications.  At this point, if you just created your Factory, the initial build 
should be finished. In the next tutorial, you will commit and push your changes 
to the remote ``containers.git`` repository.  FoundriesFactory CI will then build 
and deploy this application as a **Target** which can be applied to your device.

.. warning::

  If you followed this tutorial before flashing and registering your device, 
  return to the ``Getting Started`` section and complete the following:

   - :ref:`gs-flash-device`.
   - :ref:`gs-register`.
