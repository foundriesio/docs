## Before Working on Documentation

While optional, the following steps are encouraged before you begin working:

- [ ] Is there a Jira issue?
- [ ] Did you check against the default ("master") branch to see if work still
needs to get done?
- [ ] Have you filled out a [Change to Documentation Form](https://forms.gle/RoxtTQEvh72fFKeD8)?

It is recommended that you create a fork rather than working on a branch. In
either instance, the branch name should be descriptive and in the imperative.

## Working on Documentation

While working on documentation, Try to use spelling and grammar checks when
possible and ask a technical writer if you have questions. You should
consult the [style guide](https://foundriesio.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ID/pages/2392067/Foundries.io+Style+and+Communication+Guide)
for guidelines and suggestions. As the style guide is a "living document",
checking for changes is a good idea.

Before committing run a language linter. Currently the documentation is written
in rst, and can be checked with
[restructuredtext-lint](https://github.com/twolfson/restructuredtext-lint).

Also prior to committing, render and check locally.

When opening a Pull Request, please tag a technical writer who will merge into
the default branch once reviews have been finished.
